ASec. 1. The manuscript from which the following romance of _Sir Torrent of
Portugal_ is taken, is a folio volume on paper, of the fifteenth
century, preserved in the Chetham Library at Manchester.

A description of this volume is given by Halliwell in his _Account of
the European MSS. in the Chetham Library at Manchester_, Manchester,
1842, page 16, and by Prof. Koelbing in his _Englische Studien_, vii.
195. The only edition of this romance that we have hitherto had was done
by Halliwell. As he had, besides his own transcript, another copy made
by Madden, his text is a pretty accurate one, and therefore the results
of Prof. KoelbingaEuro(TM)s collation, printed in his _Englische Studien_, vii.
344 ff., concern, for the most part, things of little importance, except
one very curious passage, l. 88, where Halliwell renders the quite
correct reading of the MS., _pA la more de dewe_ = _par laEuro(TM)amour de dieu_,
by _Pericula more bedew[n]e_. Also, from l. 1720, the counting of the
lines is wrong by 100 lines.

A few short fragments of a printed edition were found by Halliwell in
the Douce Collection, Bodleian Library, Oxford, and added to his work as
an Appendix. They contain the following passages of theA MS.:

  Fragment III. = lines  462-489.
      aEuroz     II. =   aEuroz    492-520.
      aEuroz     VI. =   aEuroz    820-851.
      aEuroz      V. =   aEuroz    917-948.
      aEuroz     IV. =   aEuroz    949-970.
      aEuroz      I. =   aEuroz    1807-1866.

A seventh fragment, of which not much more than the rhyming words are
preserved, was omitted by Halliwell, and was printed for the first time
in Prof. KoelbingaEuro(TM)s collation.

This Chetham MS. contains the romance in a very debased and corrupt
form, so that the original reading in many passages can hardly be
recognized.[1] The scribe, who copied the poem from an older MS., lived
(no doubt) at a far later period than the poet; he did not therefore
understand a great many old expressions, and these he used to supplant
by words of his own; he also transposed and even omitted many lines, and
spoiled the rhyme, because he had not the slightest idea of the nature
of the stanza in which the poem is composed. Halliwell did not trouble
himself about the restoration of the true readings; he merely reproduced
the traditional text, even where it would have been very easy to do
more, though many passages are hopelessly corrupt; still worse is the
fact, that he did not recognize the metre as the tail-rhymed twelve-line
stanza, for he prints six-line stanzas.

    [Footnote 1: Halliwell says, Preface v f.: aEuro~It is very incorrectly
    written, and the copy of the romance of Torrent of Portugal, which
    occupies 88 pages of the book, contains so many obvious blunders
    and omissions, that it may be conjectured with great probability
    to have been written down from oral recitation.aEuro(TM)]

In consequence, the whole of the philological work on the text had still
to be done, and a new edition was plainly necessary; the more that this
poem, though not written in the best period of romance poetry, treats of
a legendary subject widely spread in the Middle Ages, and is nearly
related to another poem, _Syr Eglamour of Artois_.


ASec. 2. METRE AND VERSIFICATION.

As I mentioned before, the romance of _Sir Torrent_ is composed in the
well-known tail-rhymed twelve-line stanza, and belongs to that class of
it in which the first and the second couplets have different
rhyme-sounds (cf. Koelbing, _Amis and Amiloun_, p.A xiv ff.). Only the
incompleteness of many stanzas, and the many defects in reference to the
rhyme, can excuse Halliwell for not apprehending the character of the
metre. As to the structure of the eight lines of the four couplets, each
contains (or at least ought to contain) four accents, the _caudA|_ three;
but as we, unfortunately, possess only one MS., aA conclusive statement
on this point is impossible. There is no doubt about the fact that
neither the really incorrect rhymes nor the wanting of them can be due
to the author of the poem: even when romance poetry was decaying, the
poets were fairly perfect rhymers: with all deficiencies in this
department, the copyists are to be charged.

_Consonant_ rhymes (s. _Schipper Altengl. Metrik_, p.A 299) are found
in _Torrent_ in the following passages: l. 141 _rode--rode_ ags.
_rA'd--rAcd_. 450 _the--the_ ags. _A3/4eA cubedn--A3/4e_. 1558 _indede--dede_. 2205
_lay--lay_, _sg.--plr. prt._

_Identical_ rhymes are frequent, especially in the _caudA|_: 81
_stond--stond_. 177 _there--there_. 500 _he--hee_. 1887 _there--there_.
2538 _blithe--blithe_. 39 _take--take_. 342 _bold--bold_, a.A s.A o.

_Assonances_: 195 _bon~--Rome_. 518 _undyrstond--strong_. 537
_name--alone_. 699 _yod--fotte_. 758 _name--tane_. 896 _bryng--wynd_.
1257 _overcom~--Aragon~_. 1768 _man~--cam~_. 2164 _anon~--fome_. 2544
_sithe--hide_.

Besides the rhymes we find abundant alliteration, as in most of the
Middle English Romances. On alliteration, cf. Regel, Die alliteration in
LaE�amon, _Germ. Stud._ I. 171; F. Lindner, The alliteration in ChauceraEuro(TM)s
Canterbury Tales, _Essays on Chaucer_, Pt. III., p.A 197 ff. Koelbing,
_Sir Tristrem_, p.A xxxvii, and _Amis and Amiloun_, p. lxvi. Lindner as
well as Koelbing has adopted RegelaEuro(TM)s classification, and so shall I. The
most frequent is two alliterative words in one verse; they can be
classed in the following way:--

I. A. The same word is repeated in two succeeding lines; v. 456 f.:
_Forthe sche browght a {whyt} sted, As {whyt} as the flowyr in~ med_;
v. 618 f.: _In IV {quarters} he hym drowe, And euery {quarter} vppon a
bowe_. v. 2026 f.: _But ran into a {wilde}rnes Amongist beests that
{wyld} wes_. v. 2465 f.: _They axid {hors} and armes bryght, to
{hors}bak went thay in ffere_.

B. _Alliterative combinations, one part of which is a proper name._
_Torrent_ is several times combined with the verb _take_; 26: _Towarde
hym he {t}akythe {T}orrayne_; 224: _{T}orrent thether {t}oke the way_;
519: _{T}orrent {t}oke a dulful wey_; 2269: _Whan sir {T}orent was
{t}akyn~ than~_; 91: _Now, be my {t}rowthe, seyd {T}orent than~_; 1161:
_Alas, said {D}esoneAEsAEs the {d}ere_; 2523: _As was {d}ame {D}esoneAEsAEs_;
1906 = 1946 = 1969: _{M}ary {m}yld. To {s}end unto her {S}athanas._
v. 1091: _The {c}asteAEsAEs of {C}ardon~._

II. A. _Words of the same root are alliterative._ 133: _Torrent, on
{kne} {kne}lyd he_; 671: _That on hys {kne} he {kne}ld_; 2502: _And
{kne}lid on her {kne}_; 205: _Torrent {kne}lyd on hys {kne}_ = v. 528;
881: _And {kne}lyd vppon ys {kne}_; 1883: _She {kne}lid down~ vppon~ her
{kne}_; 2563: _Down~ they {kne}lid on~ her {kne}_; 512: _By {d}ymmynge
of the {da}y_; 1158: _For her love {d}id I never no {d}ede_; 1801: _That
ylke {d}ede, that she hath {d}one_; 1943: _How she {fl}ew in a
{ffl}ight_; 2384: _{Liffe} and {lyv}elode, whiAEsAEs I {lyve}_; 233:
_AA {lyon~} & a {lyon}asse_; 1671: _For to {se} that {s}elly {s}ight_;
407: _For the {t}alles thou hast me {t}old_; 1466: _And fals {t}alis
hym~ {t}old_; 2578: _Euer we {wiAEsAEs} be at youre {wiAEsAEs}_.

B. Relations in which alliterative words stand to each other according
to their meaning.

_a._ Concrete ideas are joined together because they belong to the same
sphere of life. 2017: _{B}yrdus and {b}estis, aye woo ye be_; 113:
_{b}one and {b}lod_; 21: _{k}yng and {k}nyght_; 83: _And ryche
{c}astelles in that {c}ontre_; 251: _In lond with a {f}yndes {f}ere_;
102: _That {f}yndes {f}are for aye_; 1094: _Both at {k}nyght and
{k}nave_; 584: _Bothe in~ {f}rethe and in {f}eld_; 660: _Stomlyng
thurrow {f}rythe and {f}en~_; 1378: _Both be {h}old and be {h}yAEsAEs_;
2398: _{l}ym~ and {l}ith_; 750: _{L}ytyAEsAEs and {m}ykyAEsAEs, {l}ese and
{m}ore_; 1899: _That was {l}ord of aAEsAEs that {l}ond_; 2152: _Loo,
{l}ordys of euery {l}ond_; 2375: _With aAEsAEs {m}aner of {m}ynstralsye_;
149: _He reynyd hys {st}ed vnto a {st}ake_; 1065: _{W}aytes on the
{w}aAEsAEs gan blowe_; 13: _{w}ater and {w}ynde_.

_b._ In the same way abstract ideas are connected, so far as they belong
to the same sphere of life. 460: _That {d}ethe ys {d}ynt schalt A3/4ou not
thole_; 1600: _Of {d}eth yaue he no {d}out_; 782 = 2062: _{f}eyer and
{f}re_; 2153: _{F}alshode wyAEsAEs haue a {f}oule end_; 1988: _{H}elpe and
{h}old I shaAEsAEs hym yeve_; 1492: _They {s}at and {s}ong_; 683: _Cryst hym
{s}aue and {s}ee_; 1303: _That he was {s}ad and {s}ore_; 1612: _set
{s}adly and {s}ore_; 335: _God that {s}ofryd wonddes {s}ore_; 322:
_{st}yff and {st}rong_ = 1491 = 2590; 1205: _That {w}ekyd was and
{w}ight_; 1584: _{w}ekyd and {w}ight_; 1849: _Her one child {w}oke and
be-gan to {w}epe_; 1559: _And {w}ot ye {w}eAEsAEs and not {w}ene_; 246:
_Sche {w}eppte_, _as sche were {w}od_.

C. The grammatical relations in which the alliterative words stand to
each other.

_a._ Subst. and adj. in attributive or predicative combinations. _As
{b}old as eny {b}ore_; _With {br}owes {br}od and wyde_; 142: _hys
{b}ugeAEsAEs {b}old_; 307: _In a {d}ongon~ that ys {d}ym_; 82: _My {f}ayer~
{f}orestes {f}ellythe downe he_; 209: _The {f}eyer~ {f}yld_; 426:
_{gl}emyrryng ase the {gl}ase_; 1592: _{g}ood {g}ate_; 171 = 596: _the
{h}oltes {h}ore_; 1484: _To an {h}ye {h}yAEsAEs_; 1183: _{s}ydes {s}are_;
154: _Thowe the {w}ey nevyr so {w}ykkyd were_; 2054: _{w}ekyd {w}eders_;
506: _In the {w}yld-some {w}ay_; 535: _{W}yldsom {w}eyes haue I {w}ent_;
2030: _She {w}ent on that {w}ilsom~ {w}ay_.

_b._ Verbs or adjectives combined with the adverb or substantive which
contains their secondary adverbial meaning. 1478: _To {b}e here at his
{b}ane_, cf. 1678: _That there his {b}ane hath {b}e_; 1944: _To her
{b}irdus was she {b}oun~_; 2016: _With {b}lis on euery {b}owE�e_; 135:
_That {b}owght hym with hys {b}lod_; 1045: _Thurrow the {b}ody he gan
hym {b}ere_; 1404: _To the {b}ote they {b}are_; 334: _Thus he {c}ovyrd
owt of {c}are_; 27: _That {d}owghtty ys in {d}edde_, cf. 1725; 98:
_With-owt {f}ere that he schold {f}are_; 603 = 977: _Also {f}ast ase he
myght {f}are_; 536: _With {f}yndes for to {f}yght_; 802: _To {f}yght
with that {f}yndes {f}ere_; 1262: _That was {gr}ow both {gr}ene and
{g}ay_; 1060 = 2330: _Torent be the {h}ond he {h}ent_; 270: _That
{m}eche ys of {m}yght_; 713: _That {m}eche wase of {m}yght_; 24: _For
God ys {m}ost of {m}yght_, cf. 1112: _To a {m}an off {m}yght_; 1879: _Vp
she {r}ose ageyn~ the {r}ough_; 2100: _Go {s}ech her in~ the {s}ee_;
2129: _And {s}ett hym~ oute in to the {s}ee_; 2469: _That {s}emely to
{s}e were_; 126: _And {s}ymly was to {s}ene_; 415: _That dare I
{s}othely {s}ey_; 1170: _Torrent {s}ett on hym~ so {s}ore_; 139:
_Serttes, yf I hym {sl}epyng {sl}one_; 181: _Torrent vndyr hys {sp}ryt
he {sp}rent_; 179: _But {st}ond {st}yAEsAEs_; 2410: _He is so {st}iff at
euery {st}oure_; 987: _Torrent in~ the {st}orrope {st}od_; 1912: _For no
{st}roke wold she {st}ynt_; 2060: _By a {t}okyn~ I shaAEsAEs the {t}eAEsAEs_;
2397: _Or {w}alkyd in {w}ede_; 383: _In hys {w}alke ther ase he {w}ent_;

ASec. 3. THE DIALECT.

The stanza of twelve lines was probably first employed in the north of
England; at least it would be difficult to prove the existence of a poem
composed in this metre in the southern part of the country; therefore it
is beforehand probable that the romance of _Torrent_ was composed either
in some part of the Midlands or in the North. In order to determine the
dialect more precisely, we restrict ourselves to a careful consideration
of the rhymes.

1. SHORT VOWELS.

Old English _Aef_ is (1) preserved before _n_ and _m_: 744 and 788 _Iame
-- +name+_. 927 _Adryan -- +jentylmane+_. 13 _+londe+ -- +wonande+_. 352
_+stond+ -- +lygand+_. 1128 _+stond+ -- +shynand+_. No part. pres.
on-_ond_ rhyming with an unvariable _-ond_ has been traced out until
now, but 1824 _+wepand+ -- wonde_ (ags. _wunden_) seems to be the first.
2. Changed into _o_. 516 _rome -- +frome+_ ags. _rA"m -- fram_. 2446
_+mon~+ -- done_. 1190 _none -- shone -- +anon+ -- done_. 1257
_+ouercom+ -- Aragon~_. 1989 _son -- +can+_ (=A _+con+_). 2040 _+anon~+
-- bone_. A curious exception is 1929 _+grame+ (=A greme) -- teme --
Ierusalem_; cf. _Gaw._ l. 312.

O.E. _e_, the _i_-umlaut of _a_, is preserved: 373 _end -- +wend+_. 476
_+went+ -- jent_. 924 _teAEsAEs -- +hell+_. 1702 _+hell+ -- DesoneAEsAEse_. 1798

contracted into _sen_. 1562 _+sene+ -- wene_.

O.E. _A|_ has become _a_: 45 _+spake+ -- take_. 363 _ffare -- +bare+_.
726 and 876 _+sale+ -- PortynggaAEsAEse_. 1074 _passe -- +was+_. 1131

    [Footnote 2: The rhymes with _tane_ and with _John_ are not
    quoted, as these words occur also as _tone_ and _Johan_; they are,
    therefore, of no use in fixing the sound of the _Ac_.]

The 3rd person sing. of the present indicative ends in _s_: 187
_+tellys+ -- ellys_. 2317 _rose -- +gose+_. 558 _+tellythe+ -- elles_
(The rhyme shows that _+tellys+_ must be inserted; cf. 103 _gos --
takythe_, and 858 _gothe -- toke_ = _+gas+ -- +tas+_.) Only once _th_
occurs: 2047 _Nazareth -- +gethe+_ (ags. _gA|A deg._). On this remarkable form
see Zupitza, _Guy of Warwick_, note on l. 11075. The plural has no
termination: 3A _+wynde+ -- ende -- lende_.

+ryding+_. 1503 _+comyng+ -- kyng_. 1933 _ryng -- +lettyng+_. 2509 _kyng
-- +lesyng+_.

Observe the 2nd pers. sing. of a past tense, 1589 _+thou cam~+ --

The _past tense plural_ of strong verbs has the same vowel as the
singular: 1452 They _+ffound+_ (r.A _ffand_) -- _goand_. 1458 _+began+ --
gentilman_. 1753 _tong -- +dong+_.

The 3rd pers. of the present indic. of _to be_ = _ys_ or _es_: cf. 738
_blyse -- +ys+_. 2413 _+ys+ -- Raynes_. Once _+ys+_ is found as plural:

-- seyn_. 2344 _+ibene+ -- kene_. 1678 _+be+ -- crystiaunte_.

From this inquiry into the sounds and inflexions, the following
conclusions can be drawn:

The development of _Aef_ is of no use in fixing the dialect. Nor is _ea_,
which has become _a_, _o_, and _e_, to be deemed a characteristic either
of the Midland or Northern dialect. Ags. _ea_ occurs as _o_ as early as
1250 in the _Northumbrian Psalter_, and 50 years afterwards in _Sir
Tristrem_ and _Sir Perceval_; even Richard Rolle in his _Pricke of
Conscience_ offers one instance of this change (cf. _Sir Tristrem_,
p. lxixA f.).

The development of the ags. _Ac_, which we find in 26 passages as _a_, in
22 as _o_, is remarkable. There are only a very few instances of this
change in _Sir Tristrem_, p. lxxi, and in the _Psalter_; and this almost
equal number of _a_- and _o_-rhymes proves evidently that the poem
cannot belong to a Northern country. At the same time, aA proportion like
that would be impossible in a text of Southern origin. The same negative
result is to be derived from the fact that Ags. _y_ is always
writtenA _y_.

As to the inflexions, the plurals of the substantives are formed by
adding _-s_ or _-n_ (_en_), or by vowel change, or they have no
inflexions at all. As for the inflexion _-n_, it only occurs in _slon_
and _shon_, and of this very word the plural in _n_ is to be met with
even in Northern writers.

The infinitives both preserve or drop the final _n_, as is the rule with
the Midland dialect; the form of the past participle with _n_ accords
with the use of the Northern writers.

The present partic. ending in _-and_ and the past tense plurals of
strong verbs having adopted the vowel of the singular, agree with the
North as well as with the northern districts of the Midland, in the same
way as some forms of _to be_: plr. prs. _ys_ and plr. prt. _was_,
besides the usual forms _be_ and _are_, resp. _were_ and _ware_, and the
contracted forms of _take_: 758 _name -- +tane+_. 1095 _gane --
+itane+_. 1825 _+ta+ -- twa_ (cf. 231, 286, 859, 1333, 1475, 1722, 1733,
2617).

The forms _thou has_ and _thou may_ point to the West.

The inflexions of the 3rd pers. prs. sg. are _-th_ and _-s_. In the
western part of the Midland we never meet with the ending _th_, but only
with _s_. In _Amis and Amiloun_, the Eastern origin of which seems to be
sure, only the inflexion _-eA3/4_ is found in the rhyme (_Amis_,
p.A xxxA ff.).

The romance of _Sir Torrent_ seems to be the first document hitherto
considered where both these forms occur, one by the side of the other.
Perhaps this fact justifies us in concluding that this poem was composed
in the east, but on the borders of the west, Midland.


ASec. 4. THE CONTENTS OF THE ROMANCE.

Before entering on an inquiry into the sources of the romance, it may be
expedient to give a short account of its contents.

  In Portugal once reigned a mighty king, whose name was Calamond.
  He had an only daughter, the fair and gentle Desonelle, who was
  loved by a young knight called Torrent, son of a Portuguese count.
  As he could not win her, save by distinguishing himself by valiant
  exploits, he undertook several adventurous expeditions. First he
  set out, by the order of the king, against a mischievous and
  dangerous giant, whom he found lying fast asleep on a hill. He
  roused the giant by sounding his bugle, and challenged him to
  fight. Instantly a fierce combat ensued, in which the awkward
  giant lost his life. In the giantaEuro(TM)s castle the young hero
  delivered a maiden, Eleonore, daughter of the king of Gales, from
  captivity, and rescued at the same time four princes, whom the
  giant had taken some time before and imprisoned in an iron cage.

  After a short rest Torrent returned into Portugal. He was kindly
  received by King Calamond, and splendid festivities were
  celebrated in his honour. The kings of Gales and of Provence
  showed their gratitude by bestowing on him rich presents, among
  them a precious sword wrought by Wayland Smith. Desonelle gave him
  one of her fine palfreys. Calamond, however, shrewd as he was, and
  envious of the heroaEuro(TM)s fame, plotted his ruin. He caused him, by a
  counterfeit letter of Desonelle, to catch her a falcon in the
  forest of Maudlen, which was the haunt of a dangerous giant,
  Rochense, and of many wild beasts. Torrent and his squire set out
  immediately, but separated on entering the forest, to hunt in the
  thicket each by himself. Torrent soon encountered a huge dragon,
  and killed it by vehement strokes. The squire, having meanwhile
  fallen in with the giant, had been slain by him. The hero, called
  to the place by the tumult of battle, attacked the giant, and
  overcame him after a hard struggle. He cut off his head to bear
  with him as a trophy. He then went into the giantaEuro(TM)s castle, where
  he found a great many jewels, and a bright sword called
  Mownpolyard. Having returned to the royal court, he ordered five
  priests to say masses for his squireaEuro(TM)s soul. At this very time it
  happened that the king of Arragon sent messengers to the king of
  Portugal, in order to bring about a marriage between Desonelle and
  his youngest son. Calamond would not listen to the advice of his
  spouse, that he should no longer refuse Desonelle to Torrent, but
  he promised her to the prince of Arragon, and at the same time
  sent the hero once more against a giant, Slogus of Foulles in
  Calabre.

  Torrent departed well armed, and after a prosperous voyage arrived
  in Calabre. There he soon met the giant, who was one-eyed like the
  Cyclops, and bore a huge cudgel as his only weapon. Torrent threw
  his spear into the fiendaEuro(TM)s eye, and thus overcame him without any
  long struggle. The king of Calabre graciously welcomed the hero,
  and largely rewarded him for the service he had rendered his
  country. Having returned into Portugal, Torrent heard that in a
  few weeks Desonelle was to be married to the prince of Arragon.
  Arrayed in knightly dress, he rode right off to CalamondaEuro(TM)s court,
  and challenged his rival to fight. After a short struggle he
  completely vanquished his antagonist, stretching him on the
  ground. The next day, as the king, surrounded by his noble guests,
  banqueted in the great hall of the castle, Torrent entered with
  the giantaEuro(TM)s head in his hand, and harshly demanded the kingaEuro(TM)s
  daughter; he called all the lords to witness of CalamondaEuro(TM)s
  perfidy.

  The Emperor of Rome now interceded, and it was agreed at his
  suggestion that Torrent should fight once more against a giant
  named Cate; if he vanquished that adversary, he should obtain
  Desonelle and half Arragon. On an isle near the sea-shore the
  struggle began in presence of the assembled knights. Torrent
  struck the club out of the giantaEuro(TM)s hand, put him to flight, and
  killed him as he ran away, casting stones at him. Then the Emperor
  decided, with the approbation of all his knights, that the hero
  had won both the land and the maiden.

  Torrent obtained Desonelle, and rejoiced in the possession of her,
  but no solemn marriage was performed.

  Twelve weeks after, he left his spouse, impelled by his venturous
  and ambitious mind; for the king of Norway asked him to fight
  against a wild giant who had carried off his daughter and was
  destroying his castles. Torrent bade his mistress farewell,
  leaving her two golden rings as talismans, and set off with fifty
  companions. Arrived at the coast of Norway, he and his companions
  entered a dense forest, in which a great many wild beasts lived.
  His companions, seized with fear, parted from him, and continued
  their voyage at sea. They told the king of Norway the false tale
  that Torrent had perished on shore. The king then set out himself
  to rescue his daughter. Torrent meanwhile encountered a giant
  named Weraunt, CateaEuro(TM)s brother, and slew him in a hard struggle,
  but was himself wounded. In the giantaEuro(TM)s castle he saved Gendres,
  daughter of the Norwegian king, and conducted her to her father.
  On the road they were met by a large train of gallant knights, and
  were then convoyed in triumph to the kingaEuro(TM)s court. There Torrent
  soon recovered from his wounds, and was amply rewarded with
  honours and presents. He stayed above twelve months at the
  Norwegian court. The false companions of Torrent were drowned in
  the sea by the kingaEuro(TM)s command, but one squire escaped to Portugal,
  and reported the tidings that Torrent yet remained in Norway. Soon
  after, as Desonelle was delivered of twins, the hatred of Calamond
  suddenly broke out against her. By his order, Desonelle and her
  two children were put to sea in a small boat; but a favourable
  wind saved them from ruin, and drove the boat upon the coast of
  Palestine. As she, helpless, wandered about the downs, aA huge
  dragon (griffin or gripe) appeared, and seized one of her
  children, and immediately after a wild leopard dragged away the
  other. With submission she suffered her miserable fate, relying on
  the help of the Holy Virgin.

  The king of Jerusalem, just returning from a voyage, happened to
  find the leopard with the child, which he ordered to be saved and
  delivered to him. Seeing from the foundlingaEuro(TM)s golden ring that the
  child was of noble descent, and pitying its helpless state, he
  took it into his palace, and brought him up as his own son (as it
  were) at his court. The child was named Leobertus.

  The dragon or gripe with the other child was seen by a pious
  hermit, St. Antony, who, though son of the king of Greece, had in
  his youth forsaken the world. Through his prayer St. Mary made the
  dragon put down the infant; Antony carried him to his father, who
  adopted him and ordered him to be baptized. He was named Antony
  fice Greffoun (Antony, son of the griffin or gripe).

  Desonelle wandered up and down, after the loss of her children,
  till she happened to meet the king of Nazareth hunting. He,
  recognizing her as the king of PortugalaEuro(TM)s daughter, gave her a
  kind welcome and assistance. At his court she lived several years
  in happy retirement. Torrent returned at length into Portugal,
  notwithstanding all the entreaties of the Norwegian king that he
  would dwell in Norway somewhat longer. At his arrival, King
  Calamond took refuge in his stronghold, and greeted him from
  thence with scornful words. Torrent, after having summoned his
  friends from Arragon, Provence, and Calabre, conquered the castle,
  and took Calamond prisoner. The traitor was sent out to sea in a
  leaky boat, and perished.

  In his stead, Torrent was elected king by all the noblemen of the
  empire, and took the crown. But forty days after this, he quitted
  his realm, having intrusted two knights with its government, and
  passed to the Holy Land at the head of a large force. There he
  fought fifteen years against the infidels, conquered several
  towns, and got immeasurable treasures as booty. The king of
  Jerusalem, hearing about TorrentaEuro(TM)s deeds, and anxious for his own
  security, sent his son Leobertus, with an army of 50,000 men,
  against Torrent. AA pitched battle began, but it was for a long
  time doubtful to which side victory would incline, till at last
  the two chiefs encountered. The son vanquishing his father decided
  the fate of the battle. Torrent was conveyed as a prisoner to
  Jerusalem, and thrown into a dungeon. There he lay above a year,
  till he was once overheard complaining his misfortunes by his son,
  who, touched with pity, prevailed upon the king to set Torrent at
  liberty. In this new state Torrent soon found an opportunity to
  show his valour and skill in arms, when a grand tournament was
  held at Jerusalem. There he proved sole victor over all the
  knights, and got the chief prize. The king of Nazareth, who had
  assisted at this joust, telling his folk at home who had won the
  prize, described the arms and escutcheon of the valiant knight. By
  these Desonelle recognized her beloved spouse. At her request the
  king called princes and knights from all parts of the world to a
  great tournament. The kings of Jerusalem, Greece, Leobertus,
  Antony fice Greffoun, and Torrent answered the call. Before an
  illustrious assembly of mighty princes and noble ladies, all of
  whom were surpassed by Desonelle in beauty and grace, the
  tournament began. Leobertus and Antony excelled in it, but the
  chief was Torrent, who performed wonders in the joust, vanquishing
  all valiant adversaries. The next morning Desonelle could no
  longer brook reserve, and was about to discover herself to
  Torrent; but overwhelmed with joy she fainted, when she had
  scarcely uttered the first words of greeting. It was not till
  midday that she was able to tell Torrent and the other knights her
  fates and those of her children. Then parents and children
  passionately embraced on recognizing each other. At TorrentaEuro(TM)s
  request, all of them, with the kings of Nazareth, Jerusalem, and
  Greece, and many attendants, sailed for Portugal. There the
  nuptials of Torrent with Desonelle were celebrated with a great
  round of splendid festivities. Torrent was finally elected Emperor
  of Rome, and reigned a long time gloriously. He lies there buried
  in a fair abbey.

  A benediction finishes the romance.

If we take a survey of the poem, we shall recognize in its conception a
harmonious plan and a certain unity of action, which, as in most of the
romances, is founded on the hero and the interest he affects us with
(See Ten Brink, _Engl. Literat._, I. p.A 317). In the centre of the
action is placed TorrentaEuro(TM)s love of Desonelle; for all the various
combats that he undertakes against dragons and giants, against the
prince of Arragon and King Calamond, are undertaken solely to gain him
Desonelle. Even his expedition against the infidels and the fighting
with his son are designed by Providence to make him find again his lost
love. Halliwell (Preface, p.A vii), therefore, is not right in deeming
the romance aEuro~aA rambling poem of adventures without much plot.aEuro(TM) The
length and tediousness of the episodes may have prevented him from
recognizing the unity of the whole. At the same time, however, it must
be admitted that the poem cannot rank with the masterpieces of romantic
poetry written in the same metre, like _Amis and Amiloun_, _Ipomadon_,
_Kyng of Tars_, _Octavian_, either in the invention of plot or in the
dissection of passions. The diction is so swelled with stereotyped
phrases, and so surfeited with trivialities, that we may justly suppose
the poem to have been composed at a period when romantic poetry had
passed its best time, and had begun to decay. As to the authorship of
the poem, it was probably composed by a monk. It is an easy thing to
show peculiarities in the course of the story which are essentially
monkish. As the romance begins and ends with a benediction, in the same
way each deed and each adventure of the hero is introduced and finished
by long prayers. Moreover, the poet points frequently to a direct
interposition of Heaven (ll. 675, 1568, 1948); he describes the anguish
and sorrow that Desonelle feels about her childrenaEuro(TM)s baptism (ll.
1892-1896 and 2074-76); he mentions emphatically Communion and
Confession (1272 and 2139), Masses (756 and 813); he finally praises the
Emperor for founding churches and abbeys (l.A 2658). On the other side,
we find very few of those marks which characterize the works of
minstrels: the poet seldom predicts the fates of his heroes to excite
the attention of his auditors; he mentions only by the way the
performances of the gleemen, and nowhere speaks of the rewards that they
get.

Passing to a special inquiry into the origin of the story of Torrent,
IA cannot persuade myself that it is of the poetaEuro(TM)s own invention, as that
would be the only instance of a Middle-English romance not being taken
from foreign originals (except, of course, ChauceraEuro(TM)s _Sir Thopas_, which
was written to ridicule this whole branch of poetry), whilst slight
alterations or additions were frequently introduced by the translators.
AA French original of the romance is supposed by Halliwell to have
existed (Preface, vi). He says, aEuro~It is probably, like the second copy of
the romance of Horn, aA modernized version of an older English romance,
which was itself translated from the French. IA have not been able to
discover any traces of the French original, but there are some singular
allusions to its origin in the poem itself. IA allude to the frequent
references to the _Book of Rome_.[3] This term was applied to the French
language, in which most of the old romances were originally written.aEuro(TM) As
for me, IA donaEuro(TM)t think that we can much rely upon references of this
kind, because they are common to all of these Middle-English romances.
Of a somewhat greater weight is perhaps the fact that one or two of the
proper names are French; and even the oath, aEuro~par laEuro(TM)amour de dieu,aEuro(TM) is
worth mentioning. After all, there is no evident proof as to the French
origin. But there is no doubt that the story of Torrent in its principal
features--the adversities of a family separated by misfortunes, the
mother robbed of her children by wild beasts, at last united
again--proceeded from the old Eustache legend.[4-5] Therewith another
motive is combined, that of the woman innocently condemned, on which
motive a large stock of legends is founded; for instance, those of
Crescentia, Sibilla, Oliva, Genovefa, Griseldis and Octavian legends.
Upon this motive and its old origin from India, see Streve, aEuro~The
Octavian legend,aEuro(TM) _Erlangen Dissert._,A 84.

    [Footnote 3: On this term see _Octavian_, ed. Sarrazin,

    [Footnote 4: See WartonaEuro(TM)s opinion upon the legendary origin of
    many romances, _History of Engl. Poetry_, London, 1824, I.
    p.A ccxliv: aEuro~Many romances were at first little more than legends
    of devotion, containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior. At
    length, as chivalry came into vogue, the youthful and active part
    of the pilgrimaEuro(TM)s life was also written. The penitent changed into
    the knight-errant.aEuro(TM) Sometimes, of course, the opposite change may
    have taken place, as for instance is probably the case with the
    story of the two faithful friends, Amis and Amiloun (cf. Koelbing,
    _Amis_, p. lxxxi), and with the story of Robert the Devil (cf.
    _Sir Gowther_, ed. Breul, p.A 74).]

    Plasidas_, 1566, by H.A H. Gibbs, for the Roxburghe Club, 1873.]

I will consider first the legend of Eustache in its original version.
According to the Greek Martyr Acts, which were probably composed in the
eighth century, this saint was before his baptism a captain of Trajan,
named Placidus. As he one day hunted in the forest, the Saviour appeared
to him between the antlers of a hart, and converted him. Placidus
changed his name into Eustache, when he was baptized with his wife and
sons. God announced to him by an angel his future martyrdom. Eustache
was afflicted by dreadful calamities, lost all his estate, and was
compelled to go abroad as a beggar with his wife and his children. As he
went on board a ship bound for Egypt, his wife was seized by the
shipmaster and carried off. Soon after, when Eustache was travelling
along the shore, his two children were borne away by a lion and a
leopard. Eustache then worked for a long time as a journeyman, till he
was discovered by the Emperor Trajan, who had sent out messengers for
him, and called him to his court. Reappointed captain, Eustache
undertook an expedition against the Dacians. During this war he found
his wife in a cottage as a gardener,--the shipmaster had fallen dead to
the ground as he ventured to touch her,--and in the same cottage he
found again his two sons as soldiers: herdsmen had rescued them from the
wild beasts, and brought them up. Glad was their meeting again! But as
they returned to Rome, they were all burnt in a glowing bull of brass by
the EmperoraEuro(TM)s order, because they refused to sacrifice to the heathen
gods.

This legend, which reminds us at once of the story of Job, has been
incorporated in almost all mediA|val collections of legends, and upon it
are founded some mediA|val poems, which are enumerated by H. Knust in his
splendid work _Dos Obras DidAicticas y dos Leyendas_, Madrid, 1878; cf.
R. KA�hler, _Zeitschrift fA1/4r rom. phil._ III, p.A 272 ff., Varnhagen,
_Anglia_, III, p.A 399 ff.; two latin versions are edited by the same,
_Zeitschrift fA1/4r deutsches Alterthum_ XXIV, p.A 241 ff., and XXV,
p.A 1A ff.

With this legend are connected, more or less, the following poems, which
it is necessary to speak of in turn:

(1) The Pseudo-Chrestien epic poem, _Guillaume daEuro(TM)Engleterre_.[6]

    [Footnote 6: _Guill. daEuro(TM)Engleterre_, ed. Fr. Michel, _Chron.
    Anglo-Norm._, III. 39-172. On the authorship of this poem see C.
    Hofmann, _Sitzungsberichte der MA1/4nch. Akad._, 1870, II. p.A 51, and
    P. Meyer, _Romania_, VIII. p.A 815A f.]

(2) The two Middle High German poems, _Die gute Frau_,[7] and (3) _Der
Graf von Savoyen_.[8]

    [Footnote 7: _Die gute Frau_, ed. E. Sommer in HauptaEuro(TM)s

    [Footnote 8: _Der Graf v. Savoyen_, ed. F. H. v. d. Hagen,
    _Minnesinger_, IV. 640, and Eschenburg, _DenkmA�ler altdeutscher
    Dichtkunst_, Bremen, 1799.]

(4) The romances of _Isumbras_; (5) of _Octavian_; (6) last, _Syr
Eglamour of Artois_, and (7) _Sir Torrent of Portugal_.

The first five have been treated by Holland in his book, _Chrestien de
Troies_, TA1/4bingen, 1854.

According to HollandaEuro(TM)s opinion, all of these are derived from the legend
of Eustache. He has not exactly inquired into each of them, but
restricts himself to a detailed account of their contents. AA critical
inquiry into these poems, except the romance of _Octavian_, has been
recently published by J. Steinbach: _Der einfluss des Crestien de Troies
auf die altenglische literatur_. Leipzig, 1886, p.A 41 ff. As to the
French and the two German poems, it may be sufficient to refer to this
exhaustive essay, since it is only by the same legendary origin that
they are connected with _Sir Torrent_; otherwise they are quite
different.

But of the English romances of _Sir Isumbras_ and of _Octavian_ it is
necessary to treat more minutely. _Isumbras_ was edited first by
Utterson in his _Select Pieces of Early Popular Poetry_, London, 1817;
secondly by Halliwell in _The Thornton Romances_, from the Lincoln MS.
A. i. 17. AA critical edition of this poem has long been promised by
Prof. Zupitza.

In this romance the legend of Eustache can be most clearly recognized.
Its contents are, indeed, somewhat transformed according to the taste of
the later Middle Ages: the Roman captain is changed into a Christian
knight, who performs wonders in fighting against the infidels; he finds
his wife as queen of a heathen country; they end their lives as mighty
princes, and so on. The legendary style has been supplanted by the
romantic diction,[9] but the leading features remain the same. In his
above-mentioned essay, pp.A 46-48, Steinbach concludes, from a detailed
comparison of the contents, that the author of _Isumbras_ did not derive
his story from the epic poem, _Guillaume daEuro(TM)Engleterre_, but from an
original which bore a still greater resemblance to the legend of
Eustache, and, at the same time, contained many of those additions which
are to be found in all versions of the legend. Whether this original was
composed in Latin, French, or Anglo-Norman, Steinbach does not pretend
to determine.

    [Footnote 9: On this text see Sarrazin, _Octav._, p. xlv; he
    speaks of aEurooedie entstellte, spielmannsmA�ssig zersungene Form, in
    der die Thornton Ms uns die legende A1/4berliefert. . . . . .
    dasselbe Pathos, dieselbe SentimentalitA�t und FrA�mmelei, aber auch
    dieselbe anschauliche und lebhafte ErzA�hlungsweise (sc. as in
    Oct.).aEuro�]

To _Isumbras_ I join a few remarks on the romance of _Octavian_, which
was edited by Halliwell for the Percy Society, _The Romance of the
Emperor Octavian_, London, 1844; and by Sarrazin, _Zwei mittelengl.
Versionen der Octaviansage_, in KoelbingaEuro(TM)s _Altengl. Bibliothek_, Band
III. As for its contents, cf. Sarrazin, as above, p.A xviii ff.
Concerning the origin of the story, he agrees in general with Holland,
only he shows a still nearer connection between _Isumbras_ and
_Octavian_, taking the former for a mere imitation of the latter. This
opinion, however, cannot be proved. As I cannot enter into detail,
IA only observe that the contents of _Octavian_ are a great deal more
complicated and copious than those of _Isumbras_, which is simple in its
plot and style, and shows the nearest resemblance to the old Eustache
legend, whilst _Octavian_ is a refined and adorned version of the
legendary tale with considerable change in the plan. Isumbras, of
course, bears a strict resemblance to Eustache, but not to the Emperor
Octavian, who has but little of the character of a suffering saint, as
he does not become an outlaw himself, nor is to lose his earthly goods.
Even those of his adventures which are conformable to the original--the
separation from his family, the rape of the children, the final
reunion--are exhibited in a different manner.

The principal contents of the romance of _Octavian_ bear internal
evidence of its later origin, as it treats chiefly of the adventures and
exploits of Florent, OctavianaEuro(TM)s son; especially in the second half of
the story, exploits of Florent so prevail that the romance might justly
bear his name on the title instead of his fatheraEuro(TM)s. IA therefore believe
that SarrazinaEuro(TM)s opinion, that _Isumbras_ is nothing but a bad imitation
of _Octavian_, is wrong; and I am rather inclined to think the two poems
were composed independently from each other, after French originals, as
is evidently the case with _Octavian_, and probably with _Isumbras_. See
Halliwell, _Thornt. Rom._, p.A xviii. Sarrazin, moreover, supposes,
p.A xlv, both poems to be due to the same author, in consequence of the
conformity of the dialect and style, and of some literal coincidences.
But the fact that both of these romances are written in the same dialect
is not sufficient to prove the identity of the authors, nor is the
style, which is nearly stereotyped in all of these romances. As to the
literal coincidences, only three of the nine passages quoted by Sarrazin
seem to me to be of any importance. See _Octavian_, notes on ll. 382,
397, 481. But even these only show that the writer of _Octavian_ knew
_Isumbras_, or _vice versAc_.

As to the relation between _Octavian_ and our poem, these two romances
have no other affinity than the same legendary origin, and the motive of
the woman innocently persecuted, which may very well have been
introduced independently by two different authors. In all other
particulars they are quite different.

The heroes bear little resemblance to their legendary models; in
_Octavian_ the Emperor of Rome; in _Torrent_ the young, hardy knight who
encounters marvellous struggles to win the hand of his spouse. Also in
the treatment of the other motive, each romance has taken its own
course. In _Octavian_, Florence is calumniated by her mother-in-law; in
_Torrent_, Desonelle is persecuted by her father. The causes are
consequently quite different: there the jealousy of the mother-in-law
against the mighty Empress; here CalamondaEuro(TM)s hatred against Torrent.
These differences, now only alluded to, cause a great number of others,
and produce a general difference of the two poems, which renders the
opinion of a nearer connection between them altogether illusory.

Of all the poems mentioned above, the last, _Syr Eglamour of Artois_, is
most nearly related to _Sir Torrent_, a fact found out by Halliwell,[10]
who, however, thought that there was no necessity for him to prove a
similarity which would be at once detected by the reader; still, he
takes it for certain that the romance of _Torrent_ is younger than and
partly founded on _Sir Eglamour_. As he gives no proof for this opinion,
it will be worth while to enter once more into this question, in order
to see whether he is right or not.

    [Footnote 10: _The Thornton Romances_, p. xxii f. aEuro~The romance of
    _Torrent_ is partly founded upon the story related in _Sir
    Eglamour_. The names are changed, but the resemblance is too
    striking to have been the result of chance. The treachery of the
    sovereign, the prowess of the knight, the indiscretions and
    misfortunes of the lady, and the happy conclusion of her
    misfortunes, these form the leading incidents of each romance
    .A .A .A . there is, perhaps, aA secret history attached to the source
    of these romances that remains to be unravelled.aEuro(TM)]

Upon it, the MSS. do not help us. The earliest MS. that can have
contained _Sir Eglamour_ is the parchment one of the Duke of
Sutherland,[11] written about the end of the 14th century. The other
four MSS. of it[12] are still later. The only MS. of _Sir Torrent_
belongs to the 15th century, so that neither of these romances can be
traced very far back.

    [Footnote 11: Cf. KoelbingaEuro(TM)s _Englische Studien_, vii. p.A 191A ff.]

    [Footnote 12: Cf. _The Thornton Romances_, p. xxv ff., and
    p.A xxxvi.]

_Sir Eglamour_ was printed several times in the beginning of the 16th
century, and edited anew by Halliwell from the Cambridge MS. in his
well-known collection. To judge from the numerous readings of the
Lincoln, Cotton, and Cambridge MSS. which he has quoted, the Lincoln MS.
shows best the original dialect, and offers in several passages a
reading preferable as to rhyme and meaning.[13] Even slight differences
in the contents occur now and then.[14]

    [Footnote 13: See the following passages which Halliwell has
    quoted in the notes: _Eglam._ 54, 96, 107, 111, 122, 128, 139,
    153, 177, 195, 213, 247, 337, 347, 399, 445, 572, 605, 614, 737,
    740, 765, 858, 883, 945, 985, 1081, 1143, 1206, 1216.]

    [Footnote 14: See _Eglamour_, notes on ll. 1064, 1082, 1267.]

The metre and probably the dialect are the same in both romances; they
are composed in the tail-rhymed twelve-line stanzas, and written in a
North Midland dialect. In both of them the style is alike swelled with
the habitual phrases; only the long prayers and pious reflections so
frequent in _Torrent_ are not to be met with in _Eglamour_. On the other
hand, the poet is wont to predict the fates of his heroes (ll. 204,
951); he often demands attention (ll. 15, 39, 343, 634, 904); he never
omits, in describing the festivals, to mention the performances of the
minstrels, and to praise the liberality of the lords. These
characteristics render it probable that the author of _Eglamour_ was a
minstrel, not a clerk or monk, as I suppose the author of _Sir Torrent_
toA be.

I now pass on to compare the contents of the two poems. The principal
features of the plot are the same in both. AA young knight who seeks the
hand of a princess engages to win her by valiant exploits. The
princessaEuro(TM)s father opposes his wooing, jealous as he is of the heroaEuro(TM)s
renown. The knight vanquishes all the giants and other monsters against
which he is told to fight, and at length gains his spouse. AA few weeks
after their marriage, he sets out again on adventurous expeditions.
While he stays abroad, his wife is delivered of twins. Her father sends
her to sea in a leaky boat; she lands on a foreign shore, where her
children are carried off by wild beasts; but they are saved in a
marvellous manner, and brought up at royal courts, whilst she herself
lives for a long time at a foreign court. As the hero, when he comes
home again, doesnaEuro(TM)t find her, he goes into the Holy Land to fight with
the infidels. After various adventures he finds his wife and children
after a tournament at a foreign court. They return home gladly, and
celebrate their nuptials by great festivals. The cruel father is duly
punished.

On entering into details, however, we find considerable discrepancies
between the two romances. First, the names are altogether different.
(Eglamour = Torrent. Crystyabelle = Desonelle. Prynsamour = Calamond.
Organata = Gendres. Degrabelle = Antony fice Greffoun.) The stage of the
plot is in _Eglamour_ Artois, Rome, and Egypt; in _Torrent_ Portugal,
Norway, and Calabre. Only the Holy Land is mentioned in both. There the
children are carried off by wild beasts, saved by princes and brought
up; there the hero fights against the infidels.

The differences of the plot itself are the following:

1. Eglamour confesses his love to Crystyabelle before his deeds;
aA squire is the go-between in his suit; Eglamour finds love in return.
In _Torrent_ Desonelle does not know that she is adored by the hero till
after his first exploit. See ll. 109, 448.

2. Accordingly, Eglamour, setting out on adventures, receives two
greyhounds and a sword of St. Paul from Crystyabelle as presents,
whereas Torrent gets an ambler from his lady love, but not till after
his first deed.

3. Prynsamour charges Eglamour with three deeds by which he is to gain
Crystyabelle. Torrent is obliged to undertake not less than five
combats.

4. In _Torrent_ the combats of the hero are enlarged and adorned by
additions not to be found in _Eglamour_. The latter does not release the
daughters and sons of kings, nor does he find precious swords in the
castles of the giants, nor is he deceived by a kingaEuro(TM)s counterfeit
letter, which causes Torrent a dangerous struggle and the rivalry of a
foreign prince. Only in _Eglamour_ (ll. 40-48) some knights are
mentioned who came to win Crystyabelle by jousting, but were all
vanquished by Eglamour.

The greatest differences are found in the second halves of the stories.

5. Crystyabelle has one child by Eglamour; Desonelle has two by Torrent.

6. Crystyabelle is driven away into Egypt, where she is graciously
received by the king. Desonelle finds refuge in the court of the king of
Nazareth.

7. Degrabelle, the son of Crystyabelle, is saved and brought up by the
king of Israel; the sons of Desonelle by the kings of Greece and
Jerusalem.

8. The father of Crystyabelle is not punished like Calamond in
_Torrent_, immediately after the heroaEuro(TM)s return, but he dies at the end
of the poem, throwing himself down from the battlements.

9. Degrabelle is sent, when fifteen years old, into Egypt by his
adoptive father to sue for a spouse. In a joust he gains the hand of his
mother and marries her. On the very wedding-day the mother recognizes
her son by his escutcheon, and the marriage is instantly dissolved.
Quite differently does the story run in _Sir Torrent_. Leobertus,
fifteen years old, marches by order of the king of Jerusalem against his
father, and takes him prisoner, but at length solicits his release.

10. The tournament, which in both poems compasses the reunion of the
separated family, is brought on in a different manner. In _Eglamour_
Degrabelle himself proposes the hand of his mother as the prize in the
next tournament, to which his father comes. In _Torrent_ Desonelle,
hearing of the victories of the strange knight, supposes him to be her
spouse from his arms, and at her request a tournament is arranged. (Her
hand seems to have been likewise the prize, as may be gleaned from
l. 2440.)

11. At the very end of the poems two slight differences are to be noted:
in _Eglamour_, Degrabelle marries Organata, daughter of the king of
Sidon, whereas the sons of Torrent return into Greece and Jerusalem.
Eglamour is crowned prince of Artois; Torrent is elected Emperor of
Rome.

From this comparison we may conclude that _Torrent_ is not directly
founded upon _Eglamour_, or _vice versAc_; the differences are too great
to justify the supposition that either is drawn from the other.
Especially is the opinion of Halliwell, which I mentioned above, to be
rejected: _Sir Torrent_ cannot be founded on _Sir Eglamour_, simply
because it agrees more closely with the old legendary tale than _Syr
Eglamour_ does, and has preserved some essential features not to be
found in _Eglamour_, in which these are supplanted by others. Desonelle,
for instance, has two children according to the old legend, Crystyabelle
one; Torrent must fight and suffer in heathen lands like Eustache,
whereas Eglamour appears as a mere knight-errant. Further, neither in
the Eustache legend nor in _Torrent_ do we find the history of the son
who marries his mother, which motive the poet may have taken from the
legend of Pope Gregory, or perhaps from the tale of _Syr DegarA(C)_.

But how can the resemblance of the leading features and the
discrepancies in particulars be explained? IA think the most probable
conjecture is, that an old poem, now lost, existed, with which the
authors of _Sir Eglamour_ and of _Sir Torrent_ were acquainted; but not
having a MS. of it, or knowing it by heart, both of them made up their
minds to rewrite the story in a well-known metre, changing, omitting,
adding whatever they liked, even filling up the gaps in their memories
by invention. Both of them recollected the first half of the story
better than the second.

That this poem was an English one seems to be shown by a good many
verbal coincidences in both poems; these I accordingly suppose to have
belonged to the lost original. They are, indeed, too frequent to be
counted simply amongst the large stock of conventional phrases which are
to be met with in every poem of this kind. Here they are:--

Perhaps some more light will be thrown on this question when we get the
much-wanted critical edition of _Sir Eglamour_; but I fear that the
aEuro~secret history attached to the source of these romancesaEuro(TM) will even then
remain to be unravelled. What I have proposed has no title to a better
name than a conjecture.


ASec. 5. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE EDITION.

As to the only MS. in which this romance has come down to us, IA have
mentioned before that it is exceedingly corrupt; many conjectures, more
or less sure, were necessary in order to restore metre, rhyme, and
meaning; the greater part of them seemed worthy to be entered in the
text, the rest being offered in the notes. No attempt has been made to
introduce a uniform character of dialect, considering the quite
unsettled state of orthography in early times. The only exceptions are
where the sounds are fully determined by the rhyme. In general the
orthography of the MS. has been reproduced as accurately as possible.
The contractions used by the scribe are expanded and printed in italics.
At the beginning of a new period, or a proper name within the line,
capitals have been introduced. From l. 1200, where the numeration of my
text no longer coincides with that of HalliwellaEuro(TM)s edition, the
line-numbers of the latter are added in brackets.

The fragments which I have added as an appendix to the text have been
consulted in all cases of difficulty, and proved of no little service in
correcting the blunders of the manuscript; they contain indeed a
somewhat better text than the MS., though they are by no means free from
clerical errors. AA detailed comparison gives the following result:

In fifty-one lines the text of the fragments is evidently correcter than
theA MS.:

  _Fragments._
      _Manuscript._

  The kyng of Nazareth sent hym me,
  Torent, I wot-saue hym on the.                         466

      Torrent, I wet-saffe of the.

  The kyng wolde fayne that he ded were,
  And he wyst nat on what manere.                        472
      The kyng wolde fayne that he wer ded,
      And hym wyst in what maner.

  To Torent that was true as stele,                      477
      To Torrent trew ase styAEsAEs,

  In what londe that they brede.                         487
      In what lond they ne bred.

  He bestrode a noble stede.                             502
      Tho he bestrod another stede.

Cf. 489, 498, 507-10, 512-15, 822, 825, 831, 833, 834, 837, 845, 848,
851, 929, 932, 933, 935, 947, 948, 951, 952, 958, 965, 968-70, 1807,
1808, 1810, 1827, 1828, 1831, 1834-36, 1844, 1854, 1866.

Forty-eight lines are coincident: 468, 470, 474, 479, 480, 486, 487,
495, 499, 501, 504, 505, 520, 823, 832, 842, 844, 846, 917, 918, 921,
922, 927, 928, 936, 938, 953, 957, 962, 1809, 1813-17, 1819-21, 1823,
1830, 1832, 1838, 1847, 1850, 1851-52, 1863, 1865.

In ninety-one lines it is doubtful which reading is to be considered as
the original one:

In eleven lines the text of the MS. is superior to that of the fragment:

Cf. 488, 503, 820, 849, 924, 1824, 1833, 1839.

As to the sixth fragment, 1014-36, and the beginning of the first (in
HalliwellaEuro(TM)s edition the third), 462-64, in which, as above mentioned,
not much more than the rhyming words are preserved, they have nearly the
same relation to the MS. as the other ones.

In the following passages they correct the rhymes of the MS.: 1017,
1018, 1028, 1033. Coincident rhymes: 1014, 1015, 1019, 1026, 1027, 1032,
1034-36. Undecided: 1020, 1021, 1023-24, 1029-30, 462-64. The rhymes of
the MS. are preferable in ll. 1016, 1022, 1025, 1031.

I need only add, that all the discrepancies between the MS. and the
fragments, however numerous they may be, concern, for the most part,
things of little importance; they are caused especially by the frequent
change of synonymous terms, by the difference of expletive words and
phrases, the transposition of words, the change of tenses, and so on.
But as there is nowhere any essential difference to be traced, we may
conjecture with great probability that the early printed edition of the
romance was taken from a manuscript which was pretty nearly related to
the Manchester MS., though somewhat more correctly written.

I gladly take the present opportunity of acknowledging my very great
obligation to Prof. Koelbing, from whom I have received ample assistance
throughout the whole of this work. It would be absolutely impossible to
me entirely to discriminate his part from mine. He carefully revised the
introduction, notes, and the glossary, before they went to press, and
after they came from it, and he looked several times through the proofs
of the text. Nor am I less indebted to Mr. Joseph Hall at Manchester,
who not only kindly read the proofs of the text with the MS. in the
Chetham Library, but also contributed some valuable notes, which are
marked by his name. The Director has added the head-lines and
side-notes.

NOTES.


PAGE 1, line 12. Cf. ll. 118, 187, 190, 198, 558, 924, 1924, 2183. So in
_Eglamour_ (Thornton Romances), l. 408:

  aEuro~The boke of Rome thus can telle,aEuro(TM)

and _The Erl of Tolouse_, ed. LA1/4dtke, l. 1219:

  aEuro~Yn Rome thys geste cronyculyd ys.aEuro(TM)

See HalliwellaEuro(TM)s and LA1/4dtkeaEuro(TM)s notes to these passages. I agree with both
of them, that an expression like that does not earnestly refer the
reader to a Latin or Italian source of the story; there is evidently no
difference at all between _in Rome_ and _in romance_.

p. 1, l. 15. _wyght_ has been inserted instead of _dowghtty_ in order to
restore the rhyme with _hyght_, _knyght_, _myght_; cf. _Havelok_, ed.
Skeat, l. 344:

  aEuro~He was fayr man and wicth.aEuro(TM)

p. 1, l. 17 = _Ipomadon_, l. 63. Parallel passages to this hyperbolic
expression are collected in KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to this line (p.A 364).

p. 1, l. 24. We find the same idea as here, viz. that nobody can resist
the will of God, who has power over death and life, in _Sir Tristrem_,
ll. 236A ff.:

  aEuro~Azat leuedi, nouE�t to lain,
  For soA3/4e ded is sche!
  Who may be ogain?
  As god wil, it schal be,
  VnbliA3/4e.aEuro(TM)

p. 2, l. 28. I have not met with the verb _fesomnen_ anywhere else, and
it is not mentioned in Stratmann and MA�tzner. Halliwell, Dictionary,
p.A 354, explains it by aEuro~feoffed, gave in fee,aEuro(TM) doubtless regarding this
very passage, although he doesnaEuro(TM)t cite it; might _fesomnyd_ not be a
corruption from _sesyd_? cf. _Havelok_, ll. 250A f.:

  aEuro~Azat he ne dede al Engelond
  Sone sayse intil his hond.aEuro(TM)

Hall writes to me on this word as follows: _fesomnyd_ is, IA am
convinced, not a word at all, but a scribeaEuro(TM)s error for _festonyd_ or
_festnyd_ = confirmed, fixed. Comp. aEuro(TM)_And A3/4at ich hym wolde myd trewA3/4e
siker faste on honde_,aEuro(TM) Robert of Gloucester (Hearne), p.A 150. For this
use of _fasten, fastnen_, comp. aEuro(TM)_But my forwarde with A3/4e I festen on
A3/4is wyse_,aEuro(TM) Alliterative Poems, p.A 47, l. 327: aEuro(TM)_& folden fayth to A3/4at
fre, festned so harde_,aEuro(TM) Sir Gawayne, p.A 57, l. 1783: aEuro(TM)_And A3/4is forward,
in faith, IA festyn with hond_,aEuro(TM) Destruction of Troy, p.A 22, l. 636. See
also JamiesonaEuro(TM)s Scottish Dictionary, ii. p.A 216, under _to Fest_.

p. 2, l. 30. I am by no means sure that _fede_ is the original reading,
but I wasnaEuro(TM)t able to find a better word rhyming with _dedde_, _wede_;
even the _ne._ aEuro~feedaEuro(TM) means _pasture_, and that is what we expect here.

p. 2, l. 31. For my correction cf. LA1/4dtkeaEuro(TM)s note to _The Erl of
Tolouse_, l. 199, sub 2; _Eglam._, l.A 26:

  aEuro~That was a maydyn as whyte as fome,aEuro(TM)

_Ib._ l. 683:

  aEuro~Crystyabelle as whyte as fome,aEuro(TM)

where the _Percy Folio MS._ reads:

  aEuro~Christabell that was as faire as sunn;aEuro(TM)

_Chronicle of England_, l. 75 f.:

  aEuro~Ant nomeliche to thy lemmon,
  That ys wyttore then the fom.aEuro(TM)

p. 2, l. 50. The alteration of _And_ and _bee_ into _An_ and _see_
seemed necessary; _sayment_ is like Fr. _essaiement_, Lat.
_exagimentum_.

p. 3, l. 59. Cf. l. 1216 f. and _The Lyfe of Ipomydon_, ed. KA�lbing,
l. 1795:

  aEuro~If thou hyr haue, thou shalt hyr bye.aEuro(TM)

p. 3, l. 77 f. As half of the stanza is lost, it is impossible to make
out to whom _they_ refers. Nor do I believe that l. 78 is correct,
especially as to _chaunce_.

p. 3, l. 79. Cf. _Ipomadon_, ed. KA�lbing, l. 8123:

  aEuro~A myle wyth in the Grekes see.aEuro(TM)

p. 3, l. 80. _in an yle_ is certainly the correct reading; _mauyle_ was
introduced by a scribe who supposed it to be the giantaEuro(TM)s name; but that
is mentioned some twenty lines later.

p. 5, l. 136. The correction of _lyght_ into _ryght_ I owe to Hall, who
refers me to the legend of _Sancta Maria Egyptiaca_; cf. f. i. BarbouraEuro(TM)s
_Legends of Saints_, ed. Horstmann, I. p.A 143A ff.

p. 6, l. 153. _nowyd_ = aEuro~anoyedaEuro(TM) gives a poor sense. Hall suggests
_nowtyd_; cf. E. D. S., No. 6, RayaEuro(TM)s _North Country Words_, p.A 59,
_note_, to push, strike or soar, with the horn, as a bull or ram,aEuro(TM) ab.
A.S. _huitan_, ejusdem significationis. The word might then mean
aEuro~spurred.aEuro(TM)

p. 6, l. 171 = l. 596. This alliterative binding is a very frequent one;
cf. _Sir Orfeo_, ed. Zielke, p.A 9.

p. 7, l. 188. The same rhyme, which I have restored here, occurs
l. 559A f.

p. 7, l. 190. _Yt tellythe_ = _Yt is told_; cf. LA1/4dtke, note to _The Erl
of Tolouse_, l. 1070, and Sarrazin, note to _Octavian_, l. 1749.

p. 9, l. 236. I was about to write, _Crystyn men thow they were_,
referring this line to the guardians of the lions; but, no doubt, HallaEuro(TM)s
reconstruction of the line, which I have put into the text, is far
better.

p. 9, l. 237. _Hys browys wexe bla_, i.e. he turned pale, he was struck
with fear; cf. _bloo askes_, P. Pl., l. 1553, and the German _aschfahl_.
Quite a similar expression occurs in _Perceval_, l. 687A f.:

  aEuro~Now sone of that salle wee see,
  Whose browes schalle blakke.aEuro(TM)

_Ib._ l. 1056:

  aEuro~His browes to blake.aEuro(TM)

p. 9, l. 245. Though _syghyng_ gives no offence, still it may be, that
the author has written _syngyng_, and the scribe was wrong in altering
it; cf. ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s note to _Guy_, l. 5424.

p. 9, l. 251. Cf. l. 802, 1204, _Ipomadon_, l. 6481 f.:

  aEuro~Your nece of Calabyre, that lady clere,
  Ys bovnden wyth a fendes fere.aEuro(TM)

_ReliquiA| AntiquA|_, i. p. 241:

  aEuro~He seith bi niE�te and eke bi day,
  That hy beth fendes ifere.aEuro(TM)

p. 10, l. 265 f. The reading of these two lines is quite destroyed by
the careless scribe. My correction is not more than an attempt to
restore the rhyme.

p. 10, l. 277 ff. There is nothing in TorrentaEuro(TM)s words which could lead
the princess to a conclusion like that. IA think that after l. 276 one
stanza is wanting.

p. 11, l. 286-8. As to the contents of these lines, KA�lbing refers me to
_Englische studien_, vol. IV. p.A 133 f., where F. Liebrecht mentions a
passage in _Sir Beves of Hamtoun_, according to which a kingaEuro(TM)s
daughter,--if she is a pure virgin,--can never be hurt by a lion. Here
we have another proof for this remarkable bit of folk-lore.

p. 11, l. 292 = l. 329.

p. 11, l. 303 = l. 342.

p. 11, l. 305. I am not quite sure whether I was right in substituting
the princeaEuro(TM)s name--which is mentioned once more, the first time, as it
were, l. 341--for the name of his fatheraEuro(TM)s kingdom; but I didnaEuro(TM)t see any
other way of restoring the rhyme.

p. 12, l. 311. Cf. l. 469 and SkeataEuro(TM)s note to _Sir Thopas_, l. 1927.

p. 12, l. 334. Instead of _he_ I should prefer to read _they_: Torrent
has just admonished the prisoners to cheerA up.

p. 13, l. 344. There must be something wrong in this line, because the
name of the third EarlaEuro(TM)s son is missing; to write _the third_ instead of
_of_ may not suffice to put the text right; even the names _Torren_ and
_Berweyne_ seem to me very suspicious.

p. 14, l. 379. Cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 4245, _for Crystys dede_; _Crystys_
was substituted by KA�lbing for _mannes_, which is clearly wrong; he
could as well have chosen _godes_.

p. 15, l. 393 ff. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 736.

p. 16, l. 427. Of this allusion to Veland, Halliwell treats in his
edition of _Sir Torrent_, p.A vii f. Cf. Zupitza, _Ein zeugnis fA1/4r die
Wieland-sage_, _Zeitschrift fA1/4r deutsches Alterthum_, Vol. XIX,
p.A 129A f.

p. 16, l. 429-31. The line which follows l. 429 in the MS. is
superfluous; it damages the metre; and the rhyme with l. 430 wonaEuro(TM)t do.
The old king wishes to say; aEuro~IA have seen the day when, if this sword
wielded by me fell on any one, he was considered done for, doomed to
death.aEuro(TM) Therefore l. 431, _IA fawght therfor I told_ has been corrected
into _Fawe they were I-told_. The scribe did not understand the
obsolescent word _fawe_ or _faye_, so he wrote the nearest word to it to
make sense, _I-told_ = aEuro~held, considered.aEuro(TM)--I. Hall.

p. 17, l. 458. Cf. BreulaEuro(TM)s note to _Sir Gowther_, l. 410.

p. 17, l. 465. Cf. l. 2061 f.

p. 20, l. 542. The scribe, who evidently didnaEuro(TM)t know the pretty rare
word _clow_, has spoilt it to _colod_, or _colvd_; the same rhyme,
_clouE�_, _drouE�_, _anouE�_ occurs in _Sir Tristrem_, l. 1761 ff. Nor did
the scribe know the word _swowe_ = aEuro~noise,aEuro(TM) and changed it to _swayne_;
cf. Hall. Dict., p.A 843: _He come to him with a swowe_.

p. 20, l. 543. _Of and on_, off and on, intermittently.

p. 21, l. 555. _schyld_ is not to the point here, Torrent having only
his sword at hand. The scribe has forgotten what he has said himself,
l. 526 and 549; cf. l. 652.

p. 21, l. 582-4. We meet with this description twice more in the poem,
ll. 1514-16, and ll. 1858-60.

p. 23, l. 640. On the meaning of _theff_, cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Am. and
Amil._, l. 787.

p. 24, l. 659. _of Perowne_ is certainly wrong, as it does not agree
with the rhymes _stere_, _nere_, _fere_; but I donaEuro(TM)t know how to amend
the line.

p. 24, l. 662. _schere_ gives no meaning; I write _stere_ and translate,
There might nobody move further, _i.e._ the giant was brought to a
standstill in the glen.

p. 24, l. 665. Cf. ll. 434, 791.

p. 25, l. 688. Cf. _Eglam._, l. 324:

  aEuro~And to [the] herte hym bare.aEuro(TM)

The weak preterit tense of _berien_ is very rare; if _bere_ = A.S.
_beran_ sometimes has the same meaning, _i.e._ aEuro~to strike,aEuro(TM) the reason
is that A.S. _beran_ and Icel. _berja_ are confounded.

p. 25, l. 696. _woo_ can hardly stand for _wood_. It seems to me like a
last corruption of an old romance phrase, like _worthy inwith wall
(woE�e)_; possibly the line was simply so: _Thus in II journeys Torrent
so_.--Hall.

p. 25, l. 700. On the use of M.E. _fote_ as a plural see ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s note
to _Guy_, l. 598.

p. 26, l. 722. Hall suggests, the original phrase may have been: _pomely
whyt and grey_; cf. Chaucer, _C.A T._, Prol., l. 615A f.:

  aEuro~This reeve sat vpon a ful good stot,
  That was al {pomely gray}, and highte Scot.aEuro(TM)

p. 27, l. 744. Cf. l. 788. On _St. James_ cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Am. and
Amil._, l. 796.

p. 29, l. 808 f. aEuro~In so dangerous conditions he has been before [and
still come back safe], so he will come back even this time.aEuro(TM)

p. 29, l. 819. On the meaning of the phrase aEuro(TM)_the bord beginne_,aEuro(TM) cf.
KA�lbing, _Englische studien_, III. p.A 104, and Zupitza, _Anglia_, III.
p.A 370A f.

p. 30, l. 838. This stanza being incomplete, I think, the lacuna is to
be put after l. 838. The missing three lines contained the fact, that
the king promises Torrent, before his knights, that, when he has done
this deed, he will give him his daughter, and grant him one half of his
kingdom during his life, and the whole afterwards; cf. l. 1206 ff. The
odd number of XXVII knights is probably due only to the scribe; cf. F.
III: _By VII score of hardy knyghtes_.

p. 31, l. 867 f. These two lines are poor, and the rhyme is very bad;
l. 868 may have run originally, _Thurrow Pervyns, for sothe, it ley_;
cf. l. 949.

p. 32, l. 901. _squyere_, although very odd at the first sight, may
still be right; Torrent says: aEuro~The only squier that I took with me for
this journey, is my swordaEuro(TM); cf. l. 909.

p. 33, l. 922. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Ipomadon_, l. 3344.

p. 33, l. 924-6. On the story of a child, begotten by a devil on a
sleeping woman, cf. Breul, _Sir Gowther_, p.A 119A f.

p. 34, l. 954 ff. Cf. _Tristrem_, l. 1409 ff.:

  aEuro~Out of Deuelin toun
  Aze folk wel fast ran,
  In a water to droun,
  So ferd were A3/4ai A3/4an.aEuro(TM)

p. 34, l. 963 f. Cf. _Beves of Hamtoun_, l. 187 f.:

  aEuro~Madame, a seide, for loue myn,
  Whar mai ich finde A3/4at wilde swin?aEuro(TM)

p. 36, l. 1000. Instead of _spere_ perhaps we ought to read _sworde_.

p. 37, l. 1030 f. If we compare the rests of these lines in F. VI., this
reading or a similar one is to be expected. The reading of l. 1029 ff.
in the fragments may be completed so: _[Thourgh the he]lpe of god of
heuen Thorough ye and] herin euen God send the spere the right way_.

p. 36, l. 1033 f. Cf. ll. 1166, 2468 f., and KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Sir
Tristrem_, l. 69A f.

p. 38, l. 1070. aEuro~I came hither to seek my death,aEuro(TM) _i.e._ this expedition
was so dangerous, that I expected to die.

p. 38, l. 1076. Cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 239 f.:

  aEuro~Tyll vncovth contreys will I wende,
  The maner wille I see.aEuro(TM)

p. 39, l. 1081. _is_ was to be corrected into _it_: aEuro~Because you slew
him that possessedA it.aEuro(TM)

p. 39, l. 1086. This line, according to HallaEuro(TM)s emendation, means: You
owe no homage or feudal due, the manor is yours and your heirsaEuro(TM) for
ever; _i.e._ the manor is in fee simple, and free from any feudal
obligation.

p. 39, st. 95. The text would be improved by putting ll. 1104-6 before
1101-3, although this transposition is not absolutely necessary.

p. 39, l. 1105. _lefte_ may be a mistake for _loste_; cf. _Gower_, I.
207:

  aEuro~Contenaunce for a A3/4rowe
  He loste.aEuro(TM)

p. 40, l. 1117. Cf. RitsonaEuro(TM)s _Met. Rom._, III. p. 341 f., and ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s
note to _Guy_, l. 436.

p. 40, l. 1121. _he bare_ looks rather suspicious, but it is supported
by l. 2169. The author is about to describe the figures inlaid on the
shield. Cf. _Eglamour_, l. 1030A f.:

  aEuro(TM)_He bare_ in azure[N1] a grype of golde,
  Rychely beton on the molde.aEuro(TM)

    [Footnote N1: So _Percy Fol. MS._; _aserre_ Thornt.]

p. 40, l. 1124. This line is hopelessly spoilt; the scribe, careless as
he was, has almost literally repeated l. 1121; l. 1125 directly
continues the description begun before.

p. 40, l. 1132. Is _than I haue in tale_ right? We expect rather: _than
I can telle in tale_.

p. 41, l. 1138 f. Cf. l. 1587 f.

p. 41, l. 1143. I thought it necessary to insert _mete_, although
MA�tzner, _WA�rterbuch_, II. p.A 274, cites this line as the only instance
in the M.E. literature for _glad_ as a substantive. But even the sense
is very poor without this addition.

p. 41, l. 1144. As to a man riding into the hall, cf. SkeataEuro(TM)s note to
ChauceraEuro(TM)s _SquiereaEuro(TM)s Tale_, l. 80, and KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Ipomadon_
l. 6253A f.

p. 41, l. 1150 f. I hope my alterations in l. 1151 are right. It cannot
be said that the King of Aragon defends the lady unless somebody has
laid claims to her. Torrent wants either three combats or the lady,
quite a regular occurrence in mediA|val romances.

p. 41, l. 1154. _none_, i.e. _no lady_.

p. 41, l. 1160. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 138.

p. 41, l. 1165. _the gres_, which word is here required by the rhyme,
is, in the same way as in this passage, used for aEuro~battle-field,aEuro(TM) in
_Perceval_, l. 1225A f.:

  aEuro~Hedes and helmys ther was,
  I telle E�ow withowttene lese,
  Many layde {one the gresse},
  And many brode schelde.aEuro(TM)

p. 42, l. 1181. _For tynding of his hand_ = for fear of (=A _for_) the
beating (blows) of his hand. Schoolboy slang still keeps the word aEuro(TM)_to
tund_aEuro(TM) = to beat with something flat.--HALL.

p. 42, l. 1193. On this expression Skeat treats in _Notes to P. Pl._,
p.A 3987, to which note I refer the reader. Cf. _Li B. Disc._, l. 130 f.
(Ritson, _Rom._ II. p.A 6):

  aEuro~Hys schon wer with gold ydyght
  And {kopeth} as a knyght.aEuro(TM)

p. 43, l. 1198 f.: aEuro~None of them said a single word, But that Torrent
had been right to do so as he had done.aEuro(TM)

p. 43, l. 1211. There is an evident contradiction between this line and
l. 1199. IA suppose the word _waried_ to be wrong; but I am not able to
give a fairly certain emendation ofA it.

p. 44, l. 1228 f.: aEuro~The king had supposed he was dead, and, indeed,
foolhardy he was to undertake an adventure like this.aEuro(TM)

p. 45, l. 1268 f. This fight between the giant Cate and Torrent reminds
us in some points of the combat between Guy and Colbrond. Like the old
northern _holmganga_, both fights take place on an island, and in both
cases the giant declines to sit on horseback, because he is too heavy;
cf. _Guy of Warwike_, Edinburgh, 1840, l. 9940A ff.:

  aEuro~When A3/4ai had sworn and ostage founde,
  Colbrond stirt vp in A3/4at stounde,
  To fiE�t he was ful felle.
  He was so michel and so vnrede,
  That no hors miE�t him lede,
  In gest as y you telle.
  So mani he hadde of armes gere,
  VnneA3/4e a cart miE�t hem bere,
  Aze Inglisse for to quelle.aEuro(TM)

p. 45, l. 1270. _he_ instead of _him_ is remarkable; this personal
construction, provided that it is right, would offer an analogue to _I
am wo_ instead of _me is wo_; cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 245.

p. 45, l. 1271 = l. 1546.

p. 46, l. 1307. This line ought probably to run thus:

  aEuro(TM)_Sir Torent praid, as was his wonne._aEuro(TM)

p. 47, l. 1337 f. This is SAINT _Nycholas de Barr_, not sir N., as the
copyist has put. He was hardly a cleric, or he would have known the Boy
Bishop. An English reference for S.A Nicholas is Alban Butler, _Lives of
the Fathers, Martyrs_, etc., vol. vii. p.A 989, Dublin, 1833. His day is
Dec. 6th, consequently he is not in _Acta Sanctorum_; see besides
_Altenglische legenden, Neue folge_, ed. Horstmann, Heilbronn, 1881, p.
11-16, and BarbouraEuro(TM)s _Legendensammlung_, ed. Horstmann, I. p.A 229-245.
_Barr_ is _Bari_ in Italy, and Barbour, I. p.A 238, l. 601 f., knew it
was two syllables (cf. the rhyme _A3/4ame be: Barre_). Nicholas was the
patron of sailors, and churches on the sea-coast in all parts of Europe
were dedicated to him. Now as Sir Torrent had been in peril at sea, he
offers to him. It was customary to offer garments at such shrines. See
Hampson, _Medii A�vi Kalendarium_, I. p.A 72. Hence I propose for l. 1338:
_AA grett Erldome and a simarr_. _Simarr_ is not a common word, which
makes it all the more probable here, since the uncommon words are those
which are corrupted and lost. See _Prompt. Parv._, I. p.A 75: aEuro(TM)_chymer,
abella_,aEuro(TM) that is aEuro~abolla, cloak.aEuro(TM) M.E. _simar_, Fr. _simarre_.--HALL.
I have not hesitated for a moment to introduce this sagacious conjecture
into the text; also the correction of _redith_ into _tas_ I owe to Mr.
Hall.

p. 48, l. 1353. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Sir Tristrem_, l. 2508.

p. 48, l. 1364. We ought probably to read _she_ instead of _he_.

p. 48, l. 1367 f. Cf. l. 1756 f.

p. 48, l. 1378. Cf. _Sir Tristrem_, l. 2458:

  aEuro~Bi holtes and bi hille.aEuro(TM)

p. 49, l. 1385 ff. Here he addresses the King of Portugal. In l. 1385
_the_ is superfluous, and should perhaps be struck out.

p. 49, l. 1395. _fend_ = _defend_; cf. ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s note to _Guy_, l. 576.

p. 51, l. 1443 f. As the existence of _fede_ = _fode_, aEuro~fellowaEuro(TM) is
proved by no other passage, we ought perhaps to write _As spede me god:
ffode_, or _As g. me save: knave_, instead of _As god me spede: ffede_.

p. 51, l. 1445. The alteration of _fleand_, which is absurd here, into
_failand_ is supported by l. 1280.

p. 51, l. 1446. As to _make_ instead of _made_, cf. l. 332.

p. 51, l. 1463. Cf. l. 2090 f. I am afraid neither of these passages is
quite right.

p. 53, l. 1518. Perhaps we ought to read:

  aEuro~And out of the valey he hyd swith.aEuro(TM)

p. 54, l. 1531. I donaEuro(TM)t believe that the poet used the word _tree_
thrice within these four lines; perhaps he wrote for l. 1531: _Shold not
drawe it, parde_.

p. 54, l. 1551. Cf. _Guy_, ed. Zupitza, l. 5430:

  aEuro~To reste A3/4er horsys a lytull wyght,aEuro(TM)

and ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s note to l. 419.

p. 55, l. 1570. Cf. StratmannaEuro(TM)s note to _Havelok_, l. 1129 (_Englische
studien_, I. p.A 424).

p. 56, l. 1592. _To the I haue full good gate_ means, aEuro~IA am fully
entitled to kill you.aEuro(TM) IA donaEuro(TM)t recollect to have met with any parallel
passage.

p. 56, l. 1600. That _dynt_ is wrong, the rhyme shows as well as the
meaning. But whether my alteration is right, seems very doubtful,
especially as l. 1609 offers the same rhyming word.

p. 58, st. 142. Rhymes like _dight_, _be-taught_, _draught_, _right_ can
by no means be admitted. Now, instead of _be-taught_ we may be allowed
to write _be-teighte_ (cf. _Beket_, l. 1827), and l. 1654 may have run:

  aEuro~He wold haue a draught, aplight.aEuro(TM)

p. 59, l. 1676. After _was_, _sent_ may have been dropped.

p. 59, l. 1692. _For his love_, i.e. aEuro~As his sweetheart.aEuro(TM)

p. 60, l. 1714. Cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 52:

  aEuro~Begge he wex of bonne and blode.aEuro(TM)

_Ib._ l. 1763:

  aEuro~Ryghtte bygge of bone and blode.aEuro(TM)

p. 60, l. 1722: aEuro~All his men agreed with him,aEuro(TM) viz. that this was the
knight whom he came to seek.

p. 62, l. 1774. Is _her day_ = A.S. _aerdagas_, cf. _Havelok_, l. 27?
The word is very rare, and in this meaning occurs only in the plural.

p. 62, l. 1777. After _king_, _on kne_ may have dropped out.

p. 63, l. 1799. Cf. Chaucer, _C. T._, the MillereaEuro(TM)s Tale, l. 325:

  aEuro~Say what thou wolt, I schal it never telle
  To child no wyf, by him that harwed helle.aEuro(TM)

_Ib._, The SompnoureaEuro(TM)s Tale, l. 407:

  aEuro~Now help, Thomas, for him that harewed helle.aEuro(TM)

Perhaps even here, l. 1702, _Iesu, that made hell_, ought to be altered
into _I. that harowde hell_.

p. 64, l. 1846. Perhaps we ought to read _ebbyng_ instead of _eb_,
according to l. 223; one can hardly say, that aEuro~the sea isA eb.aEuro(TM)

p. 68, l. 1961. Instead of _A_ I should prefer to read _The_, because
this griffon is the same which robbed the child before.

p. 69, l. 1982. _Of what lond that he is left_, i.e. aEuro~Wherever he may be
born.aEuro(TM)

p. 69, l. 1991 f. Cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 50 f.:

  aEuro~He sayd: Fro tyme he kepe tham con,
  My landes I shall hym take.aEuro(TM)

p. 70, l. 2002. _It is good in euery fight_, i.e. there is a stone in
the ring which heals wounds, if they are touched with it; cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s
note to _Ipomadon_, l. 8018.

p. 70, l. 2010. Halliwell, p. 306, explains _disparlid_ by aEuro~beaten down,
destroyed,aEuro(TM) aA meaning which is not fit for this passage. IA read with a
slight addition _disparplid_ = aEuro~dispersed,aEuro(TM) aA rare word; cf.
_Stratmann_, p.A 156.

p. 71, l. 2026. _But_ is probably to be altered into _And_.

p. 72, l. 2053. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 3068.

p. 72, l. 2075. One might be inclined to write:

  aEuro~That my two children vncrystonyd ware,aEuro(TM)

but I donaEuro(TM)t think that we are obliged to change: aEuro~I cared only for that
one thing, That my two children might be christened.aEuro(TM)

p. 74, l. 2126. For _hing_ instead of _heng_ cf. MA�tzner,
_Sprachproben_, I. 1, p.A 292, note to line 675, where _hynges_ rhymes
with _springes_.

p. 74, l. 2135. _hede vale_, i.e. principal, best choice; _vale_ =
_wale_, or perhaps aphetic for _avale_ = value.--HALL.

p. 74, l. 2138. _born_ seems to me somewhat suspicious, though I cannot
propose a better reading; _and torn_ instead of _born_ wouldnaEuro(TM)tA do.

p. 75, l. 2152. The imperfect rhyme shows that there is something wrong
in this line; it may be restored thus:

  aEuro~Loo, lordys good and hende.aEuro(TM)

p. 75, l. 2153. _wyll haue_ has probably been inserted here from the
following line; we ought to read _has_.

p. 75, l. 2157. _Season for to hold_, i.e. aEuro~in order to hold court.aEuro(TM) But
I donaEuro(TM)t know another instance of _season_ with this meaning.

p. 76, l. 2174. This line involves a contradiction to l. 2158A f.

p. 76, l. 2185. _smote_ means the same as _caste_; cf. _King Horn_, ed.
Wissmann, l. 1038:

  aEuro~And ankere gunne caste.aEuro(TM)

The only question is, whether _ankere_ is allowed to be supplied or must
be added; cf. l. 2203.

p. 77, l. 2209-2214. The Sultan informs Torrent by messengers, that the
inhabitants of the town are starving, evidently appealing to his
generosity. Torrent answers him, that if they will lie here, _i.e._
leave the town, they are to have victuals enough. But the Sultan doesnaEuro(TM)t
accept this condition, and so the siege is continued. That seems to me
to be the meaning of this half of the stanza.

p. 77, l. 2216 f. _dede_ means here, and l. 2400, aEuro~exploit, battle.aEuro(TM) In
the same way Saber, BevesaEuro(TM)s uncle, once a year on a certain day fights
against the Emperor; cf. _Sir Beues_, l. 2917A ff.:

  aEuro(TM)& eueri E�er on a dai certaine
  Vpon A3/4emperur of Almaine
  He ginneA3/4 gret bataile take,
  Beues, al for A3/4ine sake.aEuro(TM)

It agrees very well with the religious feelings of the Middle Ages, when
they thought it a merit to fight against the heathens on Good Friday;
cf. here l. 2230A ff.

p. 77, l. 2224 ff. I am afraid there is something wrong in these lines;
the copyist seems to mean, that Torrent didnaEuro(TM)t bereave the inhabitants
of their worldly goods, their treasures; then we must write _them_ for
_it_. But what we really expect here is, that he leaves in the town some
trustworthy men to keep it. Accordingly, the fault lies in _Worldely
goodis_. Besides, l. 2224, _did wyn_, instead of _was yn_, would improve
the rhyme.

p. 77, l. 2232. _bryght_ is a rather odd epithet to _SarE�ins_.

p. 78, l. 2233 ff. Fifteen years have past since Torrent began to
fight against the infidels: he besieges the first town two years (cf.
l. 2189), the second, six years (cf. l. 2206), the third, seven years
(cf. l. 2230). Meanwhile, the education of a young man being finished at
the age of fifteen (cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 287), his son
had become just old enough to win his spurs.

p. 78, l. 2240. I doubt whether _ordeyn_ can be allowed to stand without
an object, such as _your folk_, or _your ships_; cf. _Robert of
GloaEuro(TM)ster_, ed. Hearne, p.A 139, l.A 19:

  aEuro~He bigan to ordeyne ys folk, & to batail aE�en drow.aEuro(TM)

p. 78, l. 2256: aEuro~Woebegone was she, that must see that,aEuro(TM) viz. that aEuro~le
leopard took away her sone.aEuro(TM)

p. 78, l. 2259 f. The meaning of these two lines is not quite
perspicuous, and they may be corrupt; only this one thing is clear, that
these two knights are Torrent and his son, who belong to different
parties.

p. 79, l. 2269 ff. It may be that ll. 2269-71 and ll. 2272-74 are to be
transposed, but I donaEuro(TM)t think it necessary: TorrentaEuro(TM)s men flee when they
see that their chief has surrendered.

p. 80, l. 2302. _wekid_ = wicked, mischievous. But I donaEuro(TM)t recollect to
have met with this adj. as an epithet to _land_ or _country_.

p. 80, l. 2304. Cf. _Tristrem_, l. 88, KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to that passage,
and _York Plays_, p.A 438, l. 155:

  aEuro~For, certys, my lyf days are nere done.aEuro(TM)

p. 80, l. 2316. The alteration of this line is rather a radical one; but
there was no other way to restore the rhyme; IA think that first, _day_
and _nyE�t_ had changed their places in line 2313, and then the copyist,
in order to get a rhyme to _nyE�t_, spoilt the latter line.

p. 81, l. 2335. _be my ffaye_ and _parmaffay_ in the same stanza, and
both in the rhyme, are rather poor; one of these lines may have run
thus:

  aEuro~Be god of heven, the king gan say.aEuro(TM)

p. 82, l. 2357. The same confusion between _turment_ and _turnament_
occurs in _Ipomadon_, l. 2868; cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to this line.

p. 83, l. 2392. Cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 3958:

  aEuro~A mercy, syr, for Crystes pitte,aEuro(TM)

and KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to this line.

p. 83, l. 2395 f. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_, l. 3064, where he
cites an interesting parallel passage to this line from _Guy of
Warwick_, ed. Zupitza, l. 4707A f.:

  aEuro~Eoeyt A3/4ou art the trewest knyght,
  That euer slepyd in wynturs nyght.aEuro(TM)

p. 83, l. 2405. _and_ is perhaps miswritten for _an_ or _on_.

p. 83, l. 2407. This line, as it stands, is rather odd; perhaps it ought
to be identical with l. 1128.

p. 84, l. 2420. _juster_, _jouster_, means here a knight who joins in a
joust or tournament: in the only other passage where it is known to
occur, _Alis._, l. 1400, it is a horse for tourneying.

p. 84, l. 2433 = l. 2456; cf. _Ipomadon_, l. 8830:

  aEuro(TM)_Euery man in there degre._aEuro(TM)

p. 85, l. 2450. On _roial_, cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Ipomadon_, l. 64. To
_a roall ffyght_ may be compared ShakespeareaEuro(TM)s _A royal battle_ (_Rich.
III._, IV.A iv.).

p. 85, l. 2461. _with oute lent_ = aEuro~without fastingaEuro(TM)? I have not met
with this expletive phrase anywhere else.

p. 86, l. 2493. It was not superfluous to mention this fact, because
knights were very often killed in tournaments; cf. Niedner, _Das
deutsche turnier im XII. und XIII. Iahrhundert_, Berlin, 1881, p.A 24.
See also R. BrunneaEuro(TM)s _Handlyng-Synne_, ed. Furnivall, 1862, p.A 144-6.

p. 87, l. 2518-20. As to the meaning of _couplid_, cf. MA�tzner,
_WA�rterbuch_, I. p.A 491. These lines evidently mean that gentlemen and
ladies sit alternately, what one calls in German, _bunte reihe machen_.
Cf. A. Schultz, _Das hA�fische Leben Zur Zeit der Minnesinger_, I.
p.A 330, and P. Pietsch, Bunte Reihe, _Zeitschrift fA1/4r deutsche
Philologie_, vol. xvi. Halle, 1884, p.A 231, who cites from _Biterolf_,
l. 7399A ff.:

  aEuro~Do hiezens under mA(R)ne man
  Ir ingesinde wol getAcn
  Sich teilen in dem palas,
  Daz kein mA(R)n recke dAc was,
  Ern sA|ze zwischen magedA(R)n.aEuro(TM)

p. 87, l. 2526. _emell_ was added by Hall in order to restore the rhyme
with _Desonell_.

p. 88, l. 2535. For this correction, cf. ZupitzaaEuro(TM)s note to _Guy_,
l. 600.

p. 90, l. 2593. After _marked_, _them_ may have dropped; cf. _Layamon_,
l. 5642A f.:

  aEuro~And heom markede forAe',
  Touward Munt-giu heo ferden,aEuro(TM)

instead of which lines the later MSS. writes:

  aEuro~Hii nome riht hire way
  Touward Muntageu.aEuro(TM)

p. 90, l. 2597. On _castelletoure_ cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s note to _Tristrem_,
l. 158.

p. 91, l. 2636. Cf. KA�lbingaEuro(TM)s notes to _Amis and Amiloun_, l. 1019, and
to _The lyfe of Ipomadon_, l. 506. Here the expression, _no good he ne
couth_ means, he was quite feeble and strengthless.

p. 92, l. 2658. _up-tyed_ = so limited by the deed of foundation that
they (the churches and abbeys) could not be diverted to any other
purpose.--HALL.

p. 92, l. 2661. Cf. _Eglamour_, l. 1339, Lincoln MS.:

  aEuro~In Rome this romance crouned es.aEuro(TM)

The Cambridge MS. reads instead:

  aEuro~In Rome thys geste cronyculd ys.aEuro(TM)

I am inclined to think that _crouned_ is nothing else but a misreading
for _cronyculd_. Afterwards, considered to be correct, it has originated
expressions like those we find here.

_Typography_

In the Notes and Introduction, long vowels were printed with circumflex
Ac rather than macron Ae�. This usage has been retained; the circumflex
accent in its own right does not occur.

In the Introduction, emphasis within italicized passages was shown
either by reverting to Roman type or by printing the words as _gesperrt_
(extended). For this e-text, the first kind of emphasis is shown in
{braces}, the second with +marks+.

In the main text, folio numbers were italicized as 85_a_, 85_b_... This
markup has been omitted to reduce visual clutter.

Loops or flourishes attached to final letters are shown as ~ (tilde
_after_ letter). If you find this distracting, feel free to delete it
globally. The character does not occur anywhere else, and the flourishes
probably do not mean anything.

The letter aEurooenaEuro� with overline is shown as A+- (n-tilde) for better font
support.

Double aEurooelaEuro� in the main text was printed as two laEuro(TM)s with a single
connecting line. They are shown in this e-text as AEsAEs (paired l-bar).
Note that the printers do not seem to have had an italic version of this
letter pair; in the e-text it is shown as italic or roman based on the
surrounding text.


_Errors and Inconsistencies_

Errors in the main text and fragments are shown at the end of each
stanza in [[double brackets]]. The word aEurooeinvisibleaEuro� means that there is
an appropriately sized blank space or extra indentation, but the
character (usually an open single quote) is missing. Unusual spellings
in the Sidenotes are probably attributable to Frederick Furnivall.

Hyphenization of prefixes in the modern material (introduction,
linenotes, endnotes) does not always match the body text; words are
printed as shown. In citations, capitalization of German is unchanged.

Commas at the end of Glossary entries are not errors. The letters I and
J are alphabetized together. Initial U is written and alphabetized as V.
