PREFACE.


To learn to call a bird by its right name is the first step in the
study of ornithology. We may propose to investigate the structure,
food, and habits of the birds of the world, or desire merely a
superficial knowledge of the species found in our garden, but in
either case we are at once confronted by this question of
identification.

From the scientific point of view there is but one satisfactory way to
identify a bird. A specimen of it should be in hand in order that its
form, color, and size may be accurately determined, when, with the aid
of analytical keys, with which most text-books are provided, it is a
simple matter to ascertain the bird's name.

Wide experience has shown the writer, however, that where one dead
bird is identified, hundreds of attempts are made to name the living
bird in nature. This is to be expected. It is the natural outcome of
the recent remarkable interest in the study of birds which, fostered
by Audubon Societies and nature study teachers, has assumed an
ethical and educational importance of the first magnitude.

We cannot place a gun in the hands of these thousands of bird-lovers
whom we are yearly developing; indeed most of them would refuse to use
it. Specimens, therefore, are rarely available to them and we should
make some special effort to meet their peculiar wants. The present
volume has been prepared with this end in view. Identification of the
bird in the bush is its sole end; an end, however, which we trust will
prove but the beginning of a new and potent interest in nature.

PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.


In the present edition of the Color Key the body of the book, aside
from the correction of typographical errors, remains as it was in the
preceding edition. The Systematic Table has been reset and brought up
to July, 1912, the date of the publication of the latest supplement to
the third edition of the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List
of North American Birds.' Two Appendixes are added. The first includes
all the changes in nomenclature and descriptions of new birds which
have been accepted by the A.O.U. Committee on Classification and
Nomenclature since the publication of the Color Key in 1903; the
second contains a list of faunal ornithological papers which it is
hoped will add greatly to the reference value of the book.

ILLUSTRATIONS


The illustrations in this volume are designed to aid the student in
identifying birds in their haunts by giving, in color, those markings
which most quickly catch the eye. They do not pretend to be perfect
reproductions of every shade and tint of the plumage of the species
they figure, but aim to present a bird's characteristic colors as they
appear when seen at a distance. It was impracticable to draw all the
birds to the same scale but all those on the same page are so figured.
Reference should always be made, however, to the measurements given at
the beginning at each description. The figures are based on the male
bird.


LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.

  [Male].   The sign of Mars, signifying male.

  [Female]. The sign of Venus, signifying female.

  Ad. Adult, a bird in fully mature plumage.

  Yng. Young, a fully grown bird which has not yet acquired the
       plumage of the adult.

  L. Length, the distance from the tip of the bill to the end of the
     tail. This measurement is made from dead birds, birds in life
     appear somewhat shorter.

  W. Wing, the distance from the 'bend' of the wing to the end of the
     longest feather.

  T. Tail, the distance from the insertion of the tail-feathers to the
     end of the longest one.

  Tar. Tarsus, the distance from the heel to the insertion of the toes,
       or of the so-called 'leg.'

  B. Bill, the distance from the feathers at the base of the bill
     above to its tip.

   NOTE. All measurements are in inches and tenths, and a
      variation of about ten per cent. from the figures given may be
      expected. The number before the name of each species is that of
      the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North
      American Birds.'




INTRODUCTION


HOW TO LEARN A BIRD'S NAME

"How can I learn to know the birds?" is the first question of the
seeker after bird-lore. The scientist's reply, "By shooting them and
studying their structure and markings in detail," may do for the few
who, like himself, desire to know the birds scientifically; but it is
emphatically not the answer to give the ninety and nine who, while
they desire to secure an intimate, accurate knowledge of birds, will
not gain it at the sacrifice of bird-life.

In the present volume, therefore, an attempt has been made so to
group, figure, and describe our birds that any species may be named
which has been _definitely seen_. The birds are kept in their
systematic Orders, a natural arrangement, readily comprehended, but,
further than this, accepted classifications have been abandoned and
the birds have been grouped according to color and markings.

A key to the Orders gives the more prominent characters on which they
are based; telling for example, the external differences between a
Duck and a Grebe. In comparatively few instances, however, will the
beginner have much difficulty in deciding to what Order a bird
belongs. Probably eight times, out of ten the unknown bird will belong
to the Order Passeres, or Perching Birds, when one has only to select
the color section in which it should be placed, choose from among the
colored figures the bird whose identity is sought, and verify one's
selection by reading the description of the bird's characteristics and
the outline of its range.

In the case of closely related species, and particularly subspecies,
the subjects of range and season are of the utmost importance. Most
subspecies resemble their nearest allies too closely to be identified
in life by color alone, and in such cases a bird's name is to be
learned by its color in connection with its distribution and the
season in which it is seen.

During the breeding period, unless one chance to be in a region where
two races intergrade, subspecific names may be applied to the bird in
nature with some certainty, for it is a law that only one subspecies
of a species can nest in the same area; but during migrations and in
the winter, when several subspecies of one species may be found
associated, it is frequently impossible to name them with accuracy.

For example, during the summer one need have no hesitancy in calling
the Robins of the lowlands of South Carolina the Southern Robin
(_Planesticus migratorius achrusterus_) but later, when the Northern
Robins (_Planesticus migratorius migratorius_) begin to appear, it
would be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish them in life
from the resident birds.

If it were possible to impress the student, who proposes to name the
bird in the bush, with the _absolute necessity_ for careful, definite
observation he would be saved many disappointing and discouraging
experiences.

It is not possible to examine your bird too thoroughly. Never be
satisfied with a superficial view and a general impression. Look at
your bird, if you can, from several points of view; study its
appearance in detail, its size, bill, crown, back, tail, wings,
throat, breast, etc., and AT ONCE enter what you see in a note-book
kept for that purpose. In this way, and this way alone, can you expect
to compete with those who use the gun.

It does not follow, however, that because one does not collect
specimens of birds one cannot study them scientifically. While the
student may not be interested in the classification of birds purely
from the standpoint of the systematist, he is strongly urged to
acquaint himself with at least the arrangement of the Orders and
Families of our birds and their leading structural characters.

To the student who desires to prepare himself for his work afield such
a study may well come before he attempts to name the birds. But where
the chief end in view is to learn a bird's name, the more technical
side of the subject may be deferred. In any event, it should not be
neglected. This orderly arrangement of knowledge will not only be
practical benefit in one's future labors but it will bring with it
that sense of satisfaction which accompanies the assurance that we
know what we know.

As one learns to recognize bird after bird it is an admirable plan to
classify systematically one's list of bird acquaintances under their
proper Orders and Families. These may be learned at once from the
systematic table at the end of the book, where the numbers which
precede each species are arranged serially, and hence systematically.

In some instances, as an aid to identification in the field,
descriptions of birds' notes have been included. It is not supposed
that these descriptions will convey an adequate idea of a bird's song
to a person who has never heard it, but it is hoped that they may
occasionally lead to the recognition of calls or songs when they are
heard.

An adequate method of transcribing bird's notes has as yet to be
devised and the author realizes only too well how unsatisfactory the
data here presented will appear to the student. It is hoped, however,
that they may sometimes prove of assistance in naming birds in life.

As has been said before, the aim of this volume is to help students to
learn the names of our birds in their haunts. But we should be doing
scant justice to the possibilities of bird study if, even by silence,
we should imply that they ended with the learning to know the bird.
This is only the beginning of the quest which may bring us into close
intimacy with the secrets of nature. The birds' haunts and food, their
seasons and times of coming and going; their songs and habits during
courtship, their nest-building, egg-laying, incubating and care of
their young, these and a hundred other subjects connected with their
lives may claim our attention and by increasing our knowledge of
bird-life, add to our love of birds.


HOW BIRDS ARE NAMED

Birds have two kinds of names. One is a common, vernacular, or popular
name; the other is a technical or scientific name. The first is
usually given to the living bird by the people of the country it
inhabits. The second is applied to specimens of birds by
ornithologists who classify them.

Common names in their origin and use know no law. Technical names are
bestowed under the system of nomenclature established by LinnA|us and
their formation and application are governed by certain definite,
generally accepted rules. The LinnA|an system, as it is now employed by
most American ornithologists, provides that a bird, in addition to
being grouped in a certain Class, Order, Family, etc., shall have a
generic and specific name which, together, shall not be applied to
any other animal.

Our Robin, therefore, is classified and named as follows:

  CLASS AVES,

  ORDER PASSERES, Perching Birds.

  Suborder _Oscines_, Singing Perching Birds.

  Family _TurdidA|_ Thrushes.

  Subfamily _TurdinA|_ Thrushes.

  Genus, _Planesticus_, Thrushes.

  Species, _migratorius_ American Robin.

The Robin's distinctive scientific name, therefore, which it alone
possesses, is _Planesticus migratorius_. There are numerous other
members of the genus _Planesticus_, but not one of them is called
_migratorius_ and this combination of names, therefore, applied to
only one bird.

The questions Why use all these Latin terms? Why not call the bird
"Robin" and be done with it? are easily answered. Widely distributed
birds frequently have different names in different parts of their
range. The Flicker (_Colaptes auratus_), for instance, has over one
hundred common or vernacular names. Again, the same name is often
applied to wholly different birds. Our Robin (_Planesticus
migratorius_) is not even a member of the same family as the European
Robin (_Erithacus rubecola_.) If, therefore, we should write of birds
or attempt to classify them only by their common names, we should be
dealing with such unfixed quantities that the result would be
inaccurate and misleading. But by using one name in a language known
to educated people of all countries, a writer may indicate, without
danger of being misunderstood, the particular animal to which he
refers. Among people speaking the same tongue, where a definite list
of vernacular names of animals has been established, they can of
course be used instead of the scientific names.

Such a list of North American birds has been prepared by the American
Ornithologists' Union. It furnishes a common as well as scientific
name for each of our birds, and is the recognized standard of
nomenclature among American ornithologists. The names and numbers of
birds employed in this Color Key are those of the American
Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North American Birds.'

It will be observed that in this 'Check-List,' and consequently in the
following pages, many birds have three scientific names, a generic,
specific, and subspecific. The Western Robin, for example, appears as
_Planesticus migratorius propinquus_. What is the significance of this
third name?

In the days of LinnA|us, and for many years after, it was supposed that
a species was a distinct creation whose characters never varied. But
in comparatively recent years, as specimens have been gathered from
throughout the country inhabited by a species, comparison frequently
shows that specimens from one part of its range differ from those
taken in another part of its range. At intervening localities,
however, intermediate specimens will be found connecting the extremes.

Generally, these geographical variations, as they are called, are the
result of climatic conditions. For instance, in regions of heavy
rainfall a bird's colors are usually much darker than they are where
the rainfall is light. Song Sparrows, for example, are palest in the
desert region of Arizona, where the annual rainfall may not reach
eight inches, and darkest on the coast of British Columbia and Alaska,
where the annual rainfall may be over one hundred inches. In going
from one region, however, to the other the gradual changes in climate
are accompanied by gradual changes in the colors of the Song Sparrows,
and the wide differences between Arizona and Alaska Song Sparrows are
therefore bridged by a series of intermediates.

Variations of this kind are spoken of as geographic, racial, or
subspecific and the birds exhibiting them are termed subspecies. In
naming them a third name, or trinomial is employed, and the
possession of such a name indicates at once that a bird is a
geographic or racial representative of a species, with one or more
representatives of which it intergrades.

Returning now to the Robin. Our eastern Robins always have the outer
pair of tail-feathers tipped with white and, in adults, the back is
blotched with black; while Robins from the Rocky Mountains and
westward have little or no white on the outer tail-feathers, and the
back is dark gray, without black blotches. These extremes are
connected by intermediate specimens sharing the characters; of both
eastern and western birds. We do not, therefore, treat the latter as a
species, but as a subspecies, and consequently, apply to it a
subspecific name or trinomial, _Planesticus migratorius propinquus_,
(_propinquus_, meaning nearly related.)

A further study of our eastern Robin shows that in the southern parts
of its breeding range (the Carolinas and Georgia), it varies from the
northern type in being smaller in size and much paler and duller in
color; and to this second geographical variety is applied the name
_Planesticus migratorius achrusterus_, (_achrusterus_, meaning less
highly colored).

After the recognition of western and southern races of the Robin under
three names (trinomial) it would obviously be inconsistent to apply
only two names (binomial) to our eastern bird, the former being no
more subspecies of the latter than the latter is of the former. In
other words, to continue to apply only generic and specific names to
the Eastern Robin would imply that it was a full species, while the
use of a trinomial for the Western or the Southern Robin shows them to
be subspecies. As a matter of fact we know that there is but one
species of true Robin in the United States, consequently in accordance
with the logical and now generally accepted method, we apply to that
species the name _Planesticus migratorius_, and this is equally
applicable to Robins from east, south or west. When, however, we learn
that the Eastern Robin is not a species but a subspecies, we repeat
the specific name by which it was made known and call it _Planesticus
migratorius migratorius_.

It may be asked, Why give names to these geographical races? Why not
call Eastern, Western and Southern Robins by one name, _Planesticus
migratorius_, without regard to their climatic variations?

In reply, two excellent reasons may be given for the recognition of
subspecies by name; first, because in some cases they differ from one
another far more than do many species, when it would clearly be
inadvisable to apply the same name to what are obviously different
creatures. For example, it has lately been discovered by Mr. E. W.
Nelson that the small, black-throated, brown-breasted, Quails or
Bob-whites of southern Mexico, through a long series of intermediates
inhabiting the intervening region, intergrade with the large,
white-throated, black-and-white breasted, Bob-white of our northern
states. It would be absurd to call such wholly unlike birds by the
same name, nor could we give a full specific name to the Mexican
Bob-white since at no place can we draw a line definitely separating
it from the northern Bob-white. Furthermore, the use of only two names
would conceal the remarkable fact of the intergradation of two such
strikingly different birds; a fact of the first importance to students
of the evolution of species.

For much the same reason we should name those birds which show less
pronounced variations, such as are exhibited by the Robin. Here we
have a species in the making, and in tracing the relation between
cause and effect, we learn something of the influences which create
species. Thus, climate has been definitely proven so to alter a
species, both in size and color that, as we have seen in the case of
the Song Sparrows, marked climate changes are accompanied by
correspondingly marked changes in the appearance of certain animals.
In naming these animals we are, in effect, giving a 'handle to the
fact' of their evolution by environment.

Since it is evident that a bird may vary much or little, according to
the governing conditions and its tendency to respond to them, no fixed
rule can be laid down which shall decide just what degree of
difference are deserving a name. It follows, therefore, that in some
cases ornithologists do not agree upon a bird's claim to subspecific
rank.

In North America, however, questions of this kind are referred to a
committee of seven experts of the American Ornithologists' Union, and
their decision establishes a nomenclature, which is accepted as the
standard by other American ornithologists and which has been adopted
in this volume.

Foreign birds of wholly accidental occurrence, most of which have been
found in North America but once or twice, are included in the
systematic list of North American birds, but are not described or
figured in the body of the book, where their presence would tend to
convey an erroneous impression of their North American status.
Furthermore, records of the presence of birds so rare as these can be
properly based on only the capture of specimens.

In the preparation of the following pages both author and artist have
had full access to the collections of the American Museum of Natural
History, and they are also glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to
William Brewster of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Robert Ridgway,
Curator of Birds in the United States National Museum, and to C. Hart
Merriam, Chief of the Biologic Survey, for the loan of specimens for
description and illustration.

   Family 3. AUKS, MURRES, and PUFFINS. AlcidA|. 21 species, 3
   subspecies.


Grebes are at home in reed-grown ponds or sloughs where their nests
are made on rafts or islets of water-soaked vegetation. Their eggs
number from four to eight, are dull white in color, and are usually
covered by the bird with a portion of the nesting material when it
leaves its home. Grebes occasionally rest on the shore, but are rarely
found far from the water. When on land they may lie flat on their
breasts or sit erect on their tails and entire foot, or tarsus. Their
progress on land, as a rule, is awkward and they may use their wings
as fore feet to assist them. In diving, Grebes sometimes spring partly
from the water and then plunge downward head first, or they may
quietly sink with scarce a ripple to mark the place of their
disappearance.

Loons generally pass the summer on some large lake, and in the winter
many of them live at sea. They nest, as a rule, on the shore, but so
near the water that the parent bird may slide off its two dark brown,
mottled eggs into its favorite element. Like the Grebes, Loons are
expert divers, and birds of both families so often seek safety under
the water rather than in the air that it is frequently difficult to
make them fly. The young of both Grebes and Loons are born covered
with feathers and take to the water shortly after birth, often using
the back of the parent bird as an ever present island on which they
may rest at will.

The Auks, Murres, and Puffins are sea birds which nest usually in
large colonies on isolated islets or rocky, inaccessible shores of the
northern part of the northern hemisphere. They lay one or two eggs,
sometimes in an exposed position among the rocks with no attempt at
nest-building, sometimes at the end of a burrow excavated by the
birds. In the latter case, the young are reared in the nest; in the
former, they sometimes enter the water at an early age.

The one egg laid by Murres is remarkable both in color and in shape.
In color it varies from bluish green to buff, and is usually heavily
scrawled with black. In outline it is pyriform or pear-shaped. When
moved it does not roll away as would a hen's egg but revolves about
its own tip. In this manner it retains its place on the narrow ledges
often chosen by Murres for nesting-sites.

Order II. LONG-WINGED SWIMMERS.

LONGIPENNES.


   Family 1. SKUAS and JAEGERS. StercorariidA|. 4 species.

   Family 2. GULLS and TERNS. LaridA|. 37 species, 1 subspecies.

   Family 3. SKIMMERS. RynchopidA|. 1 species.


Skuas and Jaegers are pirates among the birds of the high seas. Bold
and dashing, they pursue the swift flying Terns or much larger Gulls
with equal success, forcing them to drop the fish they have captured
and catching it ere it reaches the water.

Gulls (Subfamily _LarinA|_) are usually considered so characteristic of
the sea that 'Sea Gull' is the name popularly applied to all members
of the subfamily to which they belong. Several species, however, are
equally at home, both in the winter and when nesting, on the larger
bodies of water in the interior, and one species is rarely or never
found on our sea coasts.

Gulls nest on the ground, on drifts of marsh-grass, on cliffs, and one
species, at least, among American Gulls (the Herring Gull) has as a
result of persecution, acquired the habit of nesting in trees.

Gulls feed from the surface of the water, picking up their food with
their strongly curved bills in passing or while hovering, not by
plunging into the water, as do the Terns. They are, in fact, the
scavengers of the water, and perform a service of great value to
mankind by devouring the bodies of various forms of aquatic animals
which, in dying, come to the surface and, if cast ashore, might, in
decaying, prove a source of disease.

For this reason it was especially unfortunate that the plumage of
these birds became fashionable for millinery purposes, with the result
that thousands of them were destroyed for their wings and breasts. In
this country, however, through the efforts of the American
Ornithologists' Union and the Audubon Societies, laws have been passed
prohibiting the killing of these beautiful and useful birds, and
wardens have been placed on their nesting grounds to protect them.

Gulls often rest in great flocks on the water, sitting high up and
riding the waves buoyantly, but the Terns (Subfamily _SterninA|_),
after they have acquired the power of flight, are rarely seen on the
water. They are lighter, more active birds than the Gulls, with longer
wings and tails, and sharper, more pointed bills. They feed largely on
small fish (the species called silversides being a favorite) of no
value to man, which they secure by darting from the air with great
speed and directness. When looking for food, Terns usually fly with
the bill downward, a habit which will aid in distinguishing them from
the Gulls, whose bill is carried in a line with the body.

Terns usually nest in large colonies on the beach of some isolated
islet either on our sea coasts or in the interior. The nest is
generally composed of a few wisps of sea-weed or grass, or the two or
three eggs are not infrequently laid in a slight hollow in the sand or
among the shells and pebbles.

Like the Gulls, Terns have been slaughtered in enormous numbers for
millinery purposes; but in this country, at least, effective efforts
are now being made to preserve them.

Skimmers nest in numbers on our Atlantic Coast from Virginia
southward, laying their four eggs in a slight depression in the sand.
In feeding, their mouth is held open and the longer, thin, lower
mandible is dropped beneath the surface of the water, when, flying
rapidly, they readily pick up food.

In young Skimmers, however, the two mandibles are of equal length and
the lower mandible does not become appreciably longer than the upper
one until the birds begin to fly. During the flightless period of the
bird's life, the bill may be used to pick up food along the shore, but
when the power of flight is acquired and with it ability to feed in
the characteristic Skimmer manner, then the peculiar bill of these
birds becomes fully developed.

The young of all the Gulls and Terns are born covered with down and
can leave the nest a few hours after birth. The Noddy, however, is
said to be several weeks in its stick nest, which, unlike other
members of its group, it often builds in bushes.

The young are colored to harmonize with their usual surroundings.
Young Skimmers are pale, sandy brown, of the same color as the sand in
which they are hatched. Young Terns are darker, and young Laughing
Gulls born in nests of reeds or meadow grasses, are the darkest of the
three.

All young Gulls and Terns have the habit of squatting low near the
ground in the presence of danger and remaining motionless until
actually touched when they seem to realize that they have been seen
and trust to their legs for safety.

   Family 1. ALBATROSSES. DiomedeidA|. 4 species.

   Family 2. FULMARS, SHEARWATERS, and PETRELS. ProcellariidA|.
     26 species, 1 subspecies.


The Albatrosses, of which about ten species are known, are birds of
far southern seas, where they nest on isolated islands. After the
young are reared, several species migrate northward and are found off
our Pacific coast. The largest known species, the Wandering Albatross,
which has been made famous by Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient
Mariner," measures from twelve to fourteen feet in expanse of wing,
and, like other members of this family, is a tireless ocean wanderer.

In the museum of Brown University, there is a mounted Wandering
Albatross, killed off the coast of Chili by Capt. Hiram Luther,
December 20, 1847. When captured, a small bottle was found tied around
the bird's neck, containing a slip of paper from which it was learned
that the bottle had been attached to the bird December 12, 1847, by
Capt. Edwards of the New Bedford Whaler, "Euphrates," when about 800
miles off the coast of New Zealand, or about 3,400 miles from the
point at which, eight days later, the bird was secured.

The Fulmars, (genus _Fulmarus_), are northern birds and nest in
immense numbers on isolated islets, somewhat like certain Gulls.

Comparatively little is known of the nesting places of our
Shearwaters, but it is believed that most of them breed on the islands
of the South Atlantic and South Pacific, and pass their winter, (our
summer) off our coasts.

One of the Petrels, (Wilson Petrel), is known to have this habit. It
has been found nesting on Kerguelen Island, in S. Lat. 49A deg. 54', in
February, and in May it appears off our coasts for the summer.

Petrels nest in holes in the ground, laying one white egg. They are
never seen near their homes during the day, the bird then on the nest
waiting until night to feed, when the one which has been at sea
returns to assume its share of the task of incubation. Those birds are
therefore both diurnal and nocturnal.

Order IV. TOTIPALMATE SWIMMERS.

STEGANOPODES.


   Family 1. TROPIC BIRDS. PhaA"thontidA|. 2 species.

   Family 2. GANNETS. SulidA|. 6 species.

   Family 3. DARTERS. AnhingidA|. 1 species.

   Family 4. CORMORANTS. PhalacrocoracidA|. 6 species, 5 subspecies.

   Family 5. PELICANS. PelecanidA|. 3 species.

   Family 6. MAN-O'-WAR-BIRDS. FregatidA|. 1 Species.


The members of this Order agree in having all four toes connected by
webs, but in other respects they differ widely in structure and,
consequently, in habit. The young of all the Steganopodes are born
naked, unlike the young of most of the other water birds, which, as a
rule, are hatched covered with feathers and can swim or run about soon
after birth. The nests of the Steganopodes are, of necessity,
therefore, more complex structures than those of birds whose nests are
merely incubators and not cradles as well.

Tropic Birds resemble the larger Terns, when in the air, but their
wing strokes are more rapid. They usually nest in holes in the face of
cliffs, and lay one whitish egg, marked with chocolate.

Gannets are true sea birds, but, as a rule, do not live very far from
the land. When breeding, Gannets are usually associated in great
numbers. Their nests, as a rule, are placed on the ground or on
cliffs, and one or two chalky white eggs are laid. At this season the
birds are exceedingly tame and in localities where they have not been
much molested, one may walk about among the sitting birds without
their taking flight. Gannets are powerful birds on the wing. Their
vigorous wing strokes are interrupted at intervals by short sails.
They feed on fish which they capture by diving from the air.

The Darters or Anhingas number four species, distributed throughout
the tropical parts of the globe, only one species inhabiting America.
This is generally called the Snakebird or Water Turkey in Florida,
where it is a common species on the more isolated rivers and lakes.
The name Snakebird is derived from the bird's habit of swimming with
the body submerged, when the long, sinuous neck, appearing above the
water, readily suggests a snake. At other times Snakebirds mount high
in the air and sail about, like Hawks, in wide circles. They build a
large, well-made nest in a bush or tree, generally over the water, and
lay four bluish white, chalky eggs.

Cormorants nest in large colonies, generally on isolated islets, but
sometimes in remote swamps. The nests are placed closely together on
the ground, in bushes, and less frequently in trees, according to the
nature of the bird's haunts.

Cormorants feed on fish which they catch by pursuing them under the
water. They dive from the surface of the water like Ducks, or from a
low perch, but not from the air, as do the Gannets.

Pelicans nest in colonies, generally on some small island, building
their nests on the ground or in bushes, and laying two or three large,
white, chalky eggs.

Brown Pelicans secure their food by plunging on it from the air,
generally from about twenty feet above the water. The sides of the
bill are then bowed outward, the opening widened, forming, with the
pouch, an effective net in which fish, twelve and fourteen inches
long, are captured.

White Pelicans, on the contrary, feed from the water, scooping up
fishes as they swim. At times a flock of these birds may surround a
school of small fish in shallow water and drive them shoreward, at the
same time actively filling their pouches.

Young Pelicans are fed on fish which they take from the pouch of the
parent bird by thrusting their bills and heads well into it and
prodding actively about for the food to be found there. Young
Cormorants secure their food in a similar manner.

Frigate Birds, of which only two species are known, have a greater
expanse of wing in proportion to the weight of their body than any
other bird. Their power of flight is consequently unexcelled and they
may spend days in the air without tiring. Their feet are as weak as
their wings are strong, and are of use only in perching.

The food of Frigate Birds consists chiefly of fish, which they catch
from near the surface of the water, or rob from Gulls and Terns by
pursuing them, forcing them to disgorge their prey, and catching it
ere it reaches the water.

Order V. DUCKS, GEESE, AND SWANS.

ANSERES.


  Family 1. DUCKS, GEESE, and SWANS. AnatidA|. 49 species, 6 subspecies.


The AnatidA| of North America are placed in five well-marked
subfamilies, the Mergansers (_MerginA|_), River Ducks (_AnatinA|_), Sea
Ducks (_FuligulinA|_), Geese (_AnserinA|_), and Swans (_CygninA|_).

The Mergansers, Saw-bills, or Shelldrakes are fish-eating Ducks and
their rounded bills, set with tooth-like projections along the sides,
are of evident use to them in holding their prey.

The River Ducks include such well-known species as the Mallard, Black
Duck, and Widgeon. They differ from the Bay or Sea Ducks in not having
a well-developed web or flap on the hind-toe. As a rule they feed in
shallow water by tipping, standing on their heads, as it were, while
reaching the bottom for food.

The Bay or Sea Ducks have the hind-toe webbed. They feed, as a rule,
in deeper water than the River Ducks, sometimes descending to the
bottom in water over one hundred feet deep. During the winter they
gather in flocks often of several thousand individuals, and frequent
the larger bodies of water.

With both the River and Bay Ducks the sides of the broad, flat bill
are set with gutters which serve as strainers, retaining the mollusks,
seeds and roots of aquatic plants on which these Ducks feed, while the
mud or water taken in with the food is forced out the sides of the
bill as it closes.

Geese are more terrestrial than Ducks and often visit the land to nip
the grass. This is particularly true in the west where large flocks
of, Geese, especially Snow Geese, may be seen feeding on the prairies.
On the water they feed over shallows by tipping and probing the
bottoms.

Swans also feed from the surface of the water either by simply
immersing the head and neck or by half submerging the body, when, with
the tail pointed to the zenith, the length of their reach is greatly
increased.

In spite of their comparatively short wings the large muscles attached
to them give to the AnatidA| great power of flight. Not only do they
make extended journeys, when migrating, without a rest, but they
attain a speed which is surpassed by but few birds. Some of the
smaller species, when alarmed, doubtless flying at the rate of one
hundred miles an hour.

In common with other diving water birds the Ducks, when molting, lose
most of their wing feathers all at once, and for a time are therefore
unable to fly. During this comparatively helpless period the brightly
colored males assume in part the plumage of the females and are
thereby rendered less conspicuous. With the return of the power of
flight, however, they regain their distinctive, male plumage, which is
usually brighter than that of the female. With our Geese and Swans
there is no sexual difference in color.

Most of our Ducks and Geese breed in the north, some within the Arctic
Circle, and winter from the southern limit of frozen water southward.
The American Merganser, Hooded Merganser, Wood Duck, Buffle-head,
Golden-Eyes, Tree Ducks, and possibly Harlequin Duck nest in hollow
trees, at times some distance from the water. The young of the
American Golden-eye and of the Wood Duck have been seen to reach the
water by jumping from the nest-hole and fluttering down in response to
the calls of the parent below. It is said that they are also brought
down in the bill of the old bird, but this statement apparently lacks
confirmation.

The remaining species of our Ducks, Geese, and Swans, nest as a rule,
on the ground generally near water. From five to fifteen and, in the
case of the Fulvous Tree Duck, possibly as many as thirty eggs are
laid. In color they vary from white to buffy and pale olive and are
always uniformly colored. Incubation is performed by the female alone.
The males at this period among most Ducks deserting their mate to
undergo the partial molt before mentioned. While incubating the
females surround their nest with soft down plucked from their bodies
and when leaving the nest to feed, this down is drawn over the eggs
with the double object, doubtless, of concealing them and of keeping
them warm.

With Eider Ducks this down constitutes the larger part of, if not the
entire nest. Saunders states that in Iceland the down in each nest
weighs about one-sixth of a pound. This is gathered by the natives,
who, however, are careful to afford the sitting bird an opportunity to
raise her brood without further molestation.

The collection of Eider down thus furnishes an admirable illustration
of proper economic relations between man and birds. The down is an
important source of income to the natives of the comparatively barren,
northern countries in which the Eiders nest. So long as man can
remember it has been gathered annually. Still the Ducks continue to
return in numbers year after year to the same region, perhaps the
exact spot in which they nested the year before.

Less intelligent methods would perhaps rob the bird of its second, as
well as of its first nest and, unable to reproduce its kind, the
species would become extinct within a comparatively short period.

The evils which would follow such a course are, however, thoroughly
understood. The Ducks, in the first place, are encouraged in every
way. It is said that should one walk into a peasant's cabin and
preempt his cot as a nesting-site, the peasant would gladly give up
his bed to so valuable a visitor.

   Family 1. FLAMINGOES. PhA"nicopteridA|. 1 species.


Flamingoes might be called long-legged Ducks. Their feet are webbed,
and their bill is set with ridges, which serve as sieves or strainers,
as do the 'gutters' on a Duck's bill. They are, however, wading birds
and their webbed feet are of use in supporting them on the soft mud of
shallow lagoons or bays where they search for the favorite food of
small mollusks. In feeding the flat top of the bill is pressed into
the mud when its tip points upward toward the bird's body. Flamingoes
fly with the neck and legs stretched to the utmost presenting on the
wing a picturesque, but by no means so graceful an appearance as do
the Herons. Their voice is a vibrant _honking_ like that of a Goose.

The Roseate Spoonbill was formerly a common bird in Florida and along
the Gulf coast, but so many have been killed for their plumage that in
the United States the species is now exceedingly rare except in the
most remote parts of southern Florida.

Spoonbills build a rude nest of sticks in mangrove bushes or small
trees and lay three to five whitish eggs speckled with shades of
brown.

Ibises are usually found in flocks along the shore of lagoons, lakes,
etc., or in marshy places. They fly with the neck outstretched and are
generally silent. Their nests of reeds, weed stalks, etc., are
sometimes placed in low bushes, at others in grassy marshes. The eggs
number from three to five. They are plain blue in the Glossy Ibis,
greenish white with chocolate markings, in the White Ibis.

The Storks are largely Old World birds, only three of the some twenty
known species inhabiting the Western Hemisphere. But one of these is
found regularly north of the Rio Grande, the so-called Wood Ibis which
is abundant in southern Florida. It lives in flocks and builds a nest
of sticks usually in cypress trees, often forty feet from the ground,
laying two or three white eggs. When flying the neck is extended. It
progresses by alternate flapping and sailing and occasionally soars
high overhead in circles, like a Vulture.

The Bitterns and Herons unlike our other long-legged wading birds, fly
with a fold in the neck. They belong in two subfamilies, the
_BotaurinA|_ and _ArdeinA|_, respectively. The Bitterns are usually
solitary birds inhabiting grassy or reedy marshes where their colors
harmonize with their surroundings and render them difficult to see.
The American Bittern nests on the ground and lays three to five pale
brownish eggs. The Least Bittern usually weaves a platform nest of
reeds among rushes growing in the water and lays four or five bluish
white eggs.

Herons feed along the shore and are consequently more often seen than
Bitterns. With the exception of the Green Heron and the Yellow-crowned
Night Heron, which usually nest in isolated pairs, our species gather
in colonies to nest. Several hundred pairs occupying a limited area
in some wooded or bushy swamp to which, when undisturbed, they return
year after year.

Herons build a rude platform nest of sticks, sometimes placing it in
bushes, sometimes in the tallest trees, and at others on the ground or
beds of reeds in marshes. The eggs are greenish blue in color and
usually four in number. It is among those Herons, which in nesting
time are adorned with delicate plumes or aigrettes, that the greatest
ravages of the millinery hunter have been made. Attacking these birds
when they have gathered on the nesting ground, they are not permitted
to rear their young and the species is thus exterminated branch and
root.

The voice of Herons is a harsh squawk varying in depth of tone with
the size of the bird.

   Family 3. RAILS, GALLINULES, and COOTS. RallidA|. 12 species,
        3 subspecies.


Cranes bear a general resemblance to Herons in that they are
long-legged, long-necked birds, but when on the wing, they carry the
neck fully extended, a habit which will readily distinguish them from
the curved neck Herons. Cranes are less aquatic than Herons and are
often found feeding on the prairies or pine-barrens where worms,
grasshoppers, lizards, roots, etc., form their fare. They nest on the
ground laying two buffy eggs thickly marked with brown. The young,
unlike the nearly naked, helpless young of Herons, are born covered
with down and can soon follow their parents. The Cranes have loud
sonorous voices; the Herons raucous croaks.

The Limpkin is a singular inhabitant of the more retired Florida
swamps. It feeds upon the ground largely upon a kind of land shell,
but also perches in trees. Its nest of twigs is placed in a small tree
or bush, and it lays from four to seven pale buffy eggs stained and
speckled with cinnamon brown.

The Rails (Subfamily RallinA|) are inhabitants of grassy marshes where,
trusting to their long legs, they more often escape observation by
running than by flying. One may hear their characteristic notes coming
from the dense growth only a few yards distant and still be unable to
catch a glimpse of their maker.

Rails nest on the ground laying six to twelve or fifteen buffy eggs
spotted with reddish brown. The young of all our species are born
covered with a shining black down.

The Gallinules (Subfamily GallinulinA|) are more aquatic than the Rails
and are consequently less difficult to observe.

The Coots (Subfamily FulicinA|) are still more aquatic than the
Gallinules, as might be supposed from their lobed toes, in fact are as
much at home in the water as though they were Ducks. Both Gallinules
and Coots lay eight to sixteen buffy, thickly speckled eggs in a nest
of reeds often built on a pile of rushes in the reeds.

Order IX. SHORE BIRDS.

LIMICOLA�.


   Family 1. PHALAROPES. PhalaropodidA|. 3 species.

   Family 2. AVOCETS AND STILTS. RecurvirostridA|. 2 species.

   Family 3. SNIPES, SANDPIPERS, ETC. ScolopacidA|. 33 species,
        2 subspecies.

   Family 4. PLOVERS. CharadriidA|. 9 species, 2 subspecies.

   Family 5. SURF BIRDS AND TURNSTONES. AphrizidA|. 4 species.

   Family 6. OYSTER-CATCHERS. HA|matopodidA|. 3 species.

   Family 7. JACANAS. JacanidA|. 1 species.


The Phalaropes are swimming Snipes. The Northern and Red Phalaropes,
both of which have well-developed lobes or scalloped webs on their
toes, except when nesting, live at sea a hundred miles or more off
shore, where they find an abundance of food in small forms of marine
life. The Wilson Phalarope is a bird of the interior and consequently,
is far less aquatic than the remaining species of the family;
nevertheless it readily takes to water, swimming buoyantly and
gracefully.

Contrary to the general rule, the female Phalarope is larger and more
brightly colored than the male and this difference in size and plumage
is accompanied by similarly unusual habits; the female taking the
place of the male in the Phalarope household. The female of necessity
lays the eggs, but they are hatched by the male alone, who it is said,
cares for the young, also without the assistance of his mate.

The Avocets and Stilts are wading Snipes. The Stilts secure their food
by quick thrusts of the bill, but the Avocets use their singular,
upturned member in a more interesting manner. When in water two or
three inches deep, the bill is dropped below the surface, until the
curved lower mandible evidently touches the bottom; then walking
rapidly, or even running, the bill is swung from side to side and the
bird thus explores the mud in its search for food, which, when it is
felt, is picked up in the usual way.

Many of the members of the family ScolopacidA| are probing Snipe. The
Woodcock, Wilson Snipe, and Dowitcher are good examples. Their bill is
long and sensitive and they can curve or move its tip without opening
it at the base. When the bill is thrust into the mud the tip may
therefore grasp a worm and it thus becomes a finger as well as a
probe.

Though not ranked as song birds, many of the Snipes and Plovers have
pleasing calls and whistles and in the breeding season they become
highly musical or indulge in singular vocal performances.

The song of the Bartramian Sandpiper would attract the attention of
the least observant and the singular aA"rial evolutions of the Snipe
and Woodcock lend an unusual interest to the study of these birds in
the spring. The Pectoral Sandpiper was observed by Nelson in Alaska,
in May, to fill its A"sophagus with air dilating the skin of the neck
and breast and forming a sack as large as the body. Then in the air or
on the ground the bird produced a series of hollow booming notes,
constituting its love song.

The Plovers have shorter, harder bills than the true Snipe and several
of our species frequent the uplands rather than muddy shore or tidal
flats.

The Turnstones are true shore birds. Their home with us is on the
seacoast where they feed along the beach turning over shells and
pebbles in their search for food.

The Oyster-catchers are also strictly maritime. They frequent bars
left bare by the tide and, it is said, use their stout bills to force
open mussels; oysters, or other bivalves left exposed by the water.
This belief, however, does not appear to rest on careful, definite
observation.

The Jacana belongs to a small family of birds with representatives
throughout the tropics. All its members are remarkable for the length
of their toes, the wide extent of which enable these birds to walk
over aquatic vegetation. So, for instance, I have seen them running
over small lily leaves which, sinking slightly beneath the surface,
made the birds appear to be walking on the water.

The LimicolA|, as a rule, nest on the ground. The Phalaropes, Snipes,
and Plovers lay four eggs, the Oyster-catcher three, the Jacanas, it
is said, four in some species to ten in others. The eggs of all are
proportionately large and pointed or pear-shaped and are usually
thickly marked with dark spots. The young are born covered with down
and leave the nest just after hatching.

Order X. GROUSE, PARTRIDGES, BOB-WHITES, ETC.

GALLINA�.


   Family 1. GROUSE, PARTRIDGES, etc. TetraonidA|. 21 species,
        22 subspecies.

   Family 2. TURKEYS, PHEASANTS, etc. PhasianidA|. 1 species.
        3 subspecies.

   Family 3. CURASSOWS and GUANS. CracidA|. 1 species.


The members of the family TetraonidA| are usually placed in three
subfamilies as follows: (1.) PerdicinA|, containing the true Quails and
Partridges of the Old World and with no species in America.
(2.) OdontophorinA|, including the Bob-whites and so-called 'Quails'
and 'Partridges' of the New World, and with no species in the eastern
hemisphere. (3.) TetraoninA|, the Grouse, with representatives in the
northern parts of both hemispheres. All the members of the first two
families have the legs bare, while the Grouse have the legs, and
often even the toes, more or less feathered.

The application of different names to the members of this family, in
various parts of the country, often make it uncertain just what
species is referred to under a given title. Our Bob-white, for
example, is a 'Quail' at the north and a 'Partridge' at the south. As
a matter of fact it is, strictly speaking, neither a true Quail nor
Partridge but a member of a family restricted to America.

Again, the Ruffed Grouse is a 'Partridge' at the north and a
'Pheasant' at the south, whereas in truth it is neither one nor the
other. So far as the application of these local names goes, it is to
be noted that where the Bob-white is called 'Quail' the Grouse is
called 'Partridge' and that where it is called 'Partridge' the Grouse
is known as 'Pheasant'.

All the TetraonidA| are ground-inhabiting birds, and their plumage of
blended browns, buffs and grays brings them into such close harmony
with their surroundings that, as a rule, we are unaware of the
presence of one of these birds until, with a whirring of short, stiff,
rounded wings it springs from the ground at our feet. It is this habit
of 'lying close,' as sportsmen term it, in connection with their
excellent flesh, which makes the members of this family the favorites
of the hunter and epicure and only the most stringent protective
measures will prevent their extinction as their haunts become settled.

With the Ptarmigan this harmony in color is carried to a remarkable
extreme, the birds being white in winter and brown, buff and black in
summer; while during the early fall they assume a grayish, neutral
tinted plumage to bridge over the period from the end of the nesting
season, in July, to the coming of the snow in September.

The TetraonidA| all nest on the ground, laying usually from ten to
twenty eggs. The young, like those of their relative, the domestic
fowl, are born covered with downy feathers and can run about shortly
after birth.

The Turkey is the only wild member of the PhasianidA| in this country,
but the family is well-represented in the domesticated Chickens,
Peacocks, and Pheasants, all of which have descended from Old World
ancestors. Our domesticated Turkey is derived from the Wild Turkey of
Mexico, which was introduced into Europe shortly after the Conquest
and was thence brought to eastern North America. It differs from the
Wild Turkey of the eastern United States chiefly in the color of the
tips of the upper tail-coverts. These are whitish in the domesticated
Turkey, as they are in the Mexican race from which, it has descended,
and rusty brown in the Eastern Wild Turkey.

Besides the five races of Wild Turkey described beyond, another
species of Turkey is found in America. This is the Honduras or Yucatan
Turkey, now largely confined to the peninsula of Yucatan. It is not so
large as our bird, but is even more beautifully colored, its plumage
being a harmonious combination of blue, gray and copper.

Ring-necked and 'English' Pheasants have been introduced into various
parts of the United States, and in Oregon and Washington and in the
east, on various private game preserves, they have become naturalized.
The true English Pheasant (_Phasianus colchicus_) is believed to have
been introduced into England from Asia Minor probably by the Romans.
Unlike the Ring-necked Pheasant (_Phasianus torquatus_) it has no
white collar. The last named species, however, has also been
introduced into England where it freely interbreeds with the earlier
established English Pheasant and individuals without at least a trace
of white on the neck are now comparatively rare.

The Curassows and Guans are tropical American birds, only one species
reaching the southern border of the United States. They are arboreal
in habit and form an interesting link between the Partridges, etc. and
the Pigeons.

Order XI. PIGEONS AND DOVES.

COLUMBA�.


   Family 1. PIGEONS and DOVES. ColumbidA|. 13 species, 3 subspecies.


Pigeons are distributed throughout the greater part of the globe, but
their center of abundance appears to be in the Malay Archipelago,
where about one hundred and twenty of the some three hundred known
species are found. One hundred or more species have been described
from the New World but only twelve of these inhabit North America.

The various races of domestic Pigeons, 'Pouters,' 'Fantails,' etc. are
descendants of the Rock Dove of Europe, modified in form and habit
through the selection by the breeder or 'fancier.'

Pigeons build a flimsy, platform nest of twigs and lay two white eggs.
Both sexes incubate, one relieving the other at certain hours each
day. The young are born naked and are fed by regurgitation, on
'Pigeons' milk,' the parent thrusting its bill into the mouth of its
young and discharging therein food which has been softened in its own
crop.

Some species of Pigeons nest in isolated pairs, others in large
colonies, but it is the habit of many species to gather in large
flocks after the nesting season.

The Wild or Passenger Pigeon, once so abundant in this county, was
found in flocks throughout the year. Alexander Wilson, the 'father of
American Ornithology' writing about 1808, estimated that a flock of
Wild Pigeons seen by him near Frankfort, Kentucky, contained at least
2,230,272,000 individuals. Audubon writes that in 1805 he saw
schooners at the wharves in New York city loaded in bulk with Wild
Pigeons caught up the Hudson River, which were sold at one cent each.

As late as 1876 or 1877 there was a colony of nesting Wild Pigeons in
Michigan, which was twenty-eight miles long and averaged three or four
miles in width, and in 1881 the birds were still so abundant in parts
of the Mississippi Valley that the writer saw thousands of birds,
trapped in that region, used in a Pigeon match near New York City.

Today, however, as a result of constant persecution, the Wild Pigeon
is so rare that the observation of a single individual is noteworthy.

Order XII. VULTURES, HAWKS, AND OWLS.

RAPTORES.


   Family 1. AMERICAN VULTURES. CathartidA|. 3 species.

   Family 2. FALCONS, HAWKS, EAGLES, etc. FalconidA|. 33 species,
        13 subspecies.

   Family 3. BARN OWLS. StrigidA|. 1 species.

   Family 4. HORNED OWLS. BubonidA|. 19 species, 20 subspecies.


In the Raptores we have a group of birds of great value to man but
whose services for the most part, are so little appreciated that, far
from protecting these birds, we have actually persecuted them.

The Vultures, it is true, are given credit for their good work as
scavengers and they are protected both by law and by public sentiment.
Every one knows that a living Vulture is infinitely more useful than a
dead one. As a result throughout countries inhabited by these birds
they are usually both abundant and tame, entering the cities to feed
in the streets with an assurance born of years of immunity from harm.

But how differently their kin of the family FalconidA| act in their
relations to man! 'Wild as a Hawk' has become an adage. These birds
are universally condemned. To kill one is a commendable act. Every
ones hand is raised against them. In some localities a price has
actually been set upon their heads.

A fondness for chickens, it is alleged, is the chief crime of Hawks,
and in popular parlance all Hawks are 'Chicken Hawks' and as such are
to be killed on sight.

Naturalists have long been aware that only one of our common Hawks
habitually preys upon poultry while most of our species, by feeding
largely on meadow mice, are actually beneficial. It was not, however,
until this matter received the attention of the Biological Survey of
the United States Department of Agriculture, that the economic status
of Hawks, as well as of Owls, was placed on a sound scientific basis.
In Dr. A. K. Fisher's report on the food of Hawks and Owls, issued by
the Biologic Survey in 1893, the results of the examination of the
contents of several thousands stomachs of these birds is tabulated. It
is stated, for example, that only three out of two hundred and twenty
stomachs of the so-called 'Chicken' or Red-shouldered Hawk contained
the remains of poultry, while mice were found in no less than one
hundred and two, and insects in ninety-two.

That the Sparrow Hawk is also wrongly named is clear from a study of
its food, only fifty-four out of three hundred and twenty stomachs
examined containing remains of birds, while insects were found in two
hundred and fifteen.

As a matter of fact, among our commoner Hawks, the Cooper and
Sharp-shinned are the only ones feeding largely on birds and poultry,
and if the farmer will take the pains to ascertain what kind of Hawk
it is that pays unwelcome visits to his barn-yard, he will be spared
the injustice of condemning all Hawks for the sins of one or two.

Feeding after sunset, when the small mammals are most active, Owls are
even more beneficial than Hawks. The Great Horned Owl, it is true,
has an undue fondness for poultry, but the bird is generally so rare
near thickly populated regions that on the whole it does comparatively
little harm.

Fortunately, it is those Owls which are most common in settled regions
which are of most value to man. Thus, our little Screech Owl feeds
chiefly on mice and insects. Only one of the two hundred and
fifty-five stomachs examined by Dr. Fisher contained the remains of
poultry while mice were found in ninety-one and insects in one
hundred. Of the Short-eared or Marsh Owl, seventy-seven out of one
hundred and one stomachs contained mice remains, and the same
injurious little rodents were found in eighty-four out of one hundred
and seven stomachs of the Long-eared Owl.

The bones and hair of the small mammals eaten by Owls are rolled into
oblong pellets in the stomach and are ejected at the mouth. These
pellets may often be found in large numbers beneath the roosts in
which Owls pass the day. In 200 such castings of the Barn Owl Dr.
Fisher found the remains of 454 small mammals of which no less than
225 were meadow mice.

Hawks build large-bulky nests of sticks placing them usually well up
in large trees, and lay, as a rule, four eggs which are generally
whitish, blotched with brown. The Marsh Hawk is an exception. Its nest
built largely of grasses, is placed on the ground in marshes and the
eggs, often numbering six and rarely eight, are bluish white unmarked.

The Owls nest in holes in trees or banks, or, in some instances, an
old Hawk or Crow nest may be occupied. The eggs usually number three
to five and are always pure white.

Order XIII. PAROQUETS AND PARROTS.

PSITTACI.


  Family 1. PARROTS and PAROQUETS. PsittacidA|. 2 species.


Parrots are found throughout the warmer parts of the earth. About one
hundred and fifty of the some five hundred known species inhabit
America. The Carolina Paroquet, practically the only member of this
family found in the United States, since the Thick-billed Parrot
barely reaches our border in Arizona, was once an abundant bird in the
Southern States, but it is now restricted to a few localities in
Florida and possibly Indian Territory.




Order XIV. CUCKOOS, TROGONS, KINGFISHERS, Etc.

COCCYGES.


   Family 1. CUCKOOS, ANIS, etc. CuculidA|. 5 species 2 subspecies.

   Family 2. TROGONS. TrogonidA|. 1 species.

   Family 3. KINGFISHERS. AlcedinidA|. 2 species.

The Cuckoos are a group of world-wide distribution, but are more
numerous in the eastern than in the western hemisphere where only
thirty-five of the some one hundred and seventy-five species are
found. The habit of the European Cuckoo in placing its eggs in the
nest of other birds is well known. The American species, however,
build nests of their own though it is true they are far from well made
structures. With the Anis one nest serves for several females who may
deposit as many as thirty eggs, incubation and the care of the young
being subsequently shared by the members of this singular family.

Trogons are found in the tropics of both the Old and New Worlds. They
are quiet, sedentary birds inhabiting forests and feeding largely on
fruit. So far as is known they nest in hollow trees.

Only eight of the one hundred and eighty or more known Kingfishers are
found in America, the remaining species being confined to the Old
World where they are most numerous in the Malay Archipelago.

Order XV. WOODPECKERS.

PICI.


   Family 1. WOODPECKERS. PicidA|. 24 species, 22 subspecies.


The some three hundred and fifty known species of Woodpeckers are
distributed throughout the wooded parts of the world, except in
Australia and Madagascar, nearly one half of this number being found
in the New World. Feeding largely upon the eggs and larvA| of insects,
which they can obtain at all seasons, most of the North American
species are not highly migratory but are represented in the more
northern parts of their range at all times of the year.

Woodpeckers nest in holes in trees generally excavated by themselves.
The eggs, four to eight or nine in number, like those of most birds
that lay in covered situations, are pure white. The young are born
naked and are reared in the nest.

In few birds is the close relation between structure and habit more
strikingly illustrated than in the Woodpeckers. Their lengthened toes
placed two before and two behind (except in one genus) and armed with
strong nails enable them readily to grasp the bark of trees up which
they climb. Their stiffened, pointed tail-feathers are also of
assistance to them in retaining their position on tree trunks, serving
as a prop on which they may rest while chiseling out their homes or
laying bare the tunnels of the grubs of wood boring beetles. For this
purpose they use their bill, a marvellously effective tool with which
some of the large Woodpeckers perform astonishing feats. I have seen
an opening made by a Pileated Woodpecker in a white pine tree, twelve
inches long, four inches wide, and eight inches deep, through
perfectly sound wood to reach the larvA| at work in the heart of the
tree. The bill is also used as a musical instrument, the 'song' of
Woodpeckers being a rolling tattoo produced by rapid tappings on some
resonant limb.

As might be supposed the Woodpeckers are great of economic value.
Professor Beal states that at least two-thirds to three-fourths of the
food of our common Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers consists chiefly of
noxious insects.

Order XVI. GOATSUCKERS, SWIFTS, AND HUMMINGBIRDS.

MACROCHIRES.


   Family 1. GOATSUCKERS. CaprimulgidA|. 6 species, 6 subspecies.

   Family 2. SWIFTS. MicropodidA|. 4 species.

   Family 3. HUMMINGBIRDS. TrochilidA|. 17 species.

The Goatsuckers are birds of the dusk and early morning. They live
chiefly on insects which they capture on the wing, their enormous
mouths being especially well adapted to this kind of hunting. Our
species build no nest but lay their two mottled eggs on the bare
ground or leaves. The young are hatched covered with down and can
follow their parents about long before they acquire the power of
flight. Goatsuckers are noted for their singular calls, most of the
species uttering loud, characteristic notes which, heard at night, are
especially effective.

Swifts are birds of world-wide distribution; about half the
seventy-five known species being found in America. They are
pre-eminently birds of the air with wings so well developed that few
birds can surpass them in power of flight, but with feet so weak and
small that many species cannot perch as do most birds, but, when
resting, cling to a vertical surface and use their tail to aid their
feet in supporting themselves. Their nests are often marvels of
architectural skill and constructive ability. The eggs, four to six in
number, are white.

Hummingbirds are found only in America where they range from Patagonia
to Alaska, but the larger part of the some five hundred known species
are found in the Andean region of Columbia and Ecuador. Only one
species is found east of the Mississippi, and nine of our sixteen
western species advance but little beyond our Mexican border.

Hummingbirds nests are the most exquisite of birds' homes. Their eggs,
so far as is known, number two, and are pure white. The young are born
naked and, in the case of our Ruby-throat, at least, spend about three
weeks in the nest.

The notes of some tropical Hummingbirds are sufficiently varied to be
classed as songs but our species utter only sharp squeaks and excited
chipperings.

The North American members of the Order PASSERES are placed in two
Suborders, the _Clamatores_, or so-called Songless Perching Birds,
which includes all the Flycatchers, and the Suborder _Oscines_, or
Singing Perching Birds, which includes all our remaining Perching
Birds. While the Flycatchers are therefore technically classed as
songless birds, it does not follow that they have no songs. Sing they
do, but because of the less developed condition of their
voice-producing organ, they cannot give utterance to the longer and
more musical songs of the Oscines, which are supplied with a better
musical instrument.

The Flycatchers, (Family TyrannidA|) number somewhat over three hundred
and fifty species, and are found only in America, where they are most
abundant in the tropics. Feeding almost exclusively on insects, those
species which visit the United States are of necessity migratory, not
more than half a dozen of the thirty species which nest with us,
remaining in the United States during the winter, and these are found
only on our southern borders.

Flycatchers as a rule, capture their prey on the wing. When perching,
their pose is usually erect and hawk-like. They often raise their
crown feathers, which in many species are somewhat lengthened, a habit
giving them a certain big-headed appearance.

Flycatchers are most useful birds. The food of the Kingbird, for
example, a species which is erroneously believed to destroy honey
bees, has been found to consist of 90 per cent. insects, mostly
injurious species, while only fourteen out of two hundred and
eighty-one stomachs contained the remains of honey bees; forty of the
fifty bees found being drones.


The true Larks, (Family _AlaudidA|_) are chiefly Old World birds, the
Skylark being the best known member of the Family. In America we have
only the Horned or Shore Larks, one species of which shows so much
climatic variation in color throughout its wide range, that no less
than thirteen subspecies or geographical races of it are recognized in
the United States.

The Horned Lark is a bird of the plains and prairies and is less
common in the Atlantic States than westward. Like the Skylark it sings
in the air, but its vocal powers are limited and not to be compared
with those of its famous relative.


The Crows and Jays, (Family _CorvidA|_) number about two hundred
species of which some twenty-five inhabit the western hemisphere. To
this family belong the Raven, Rook, Magpie and Jackdaw, all birds of
marked intelligence; and our Crows and Jays are fully worthy of being
classed with these widely known and distinguished members of their
family.

The Crows and Jays, by varying their food with the season, are rarely
at loss for supplies of one kind or another and most species are
represented throughout their ranges at all times of the year. In the
more northern parts of their homes, however, some of these birds are
migratory, and Crows, as is well known, gather in great flocks during
the winter, returning each night to a roost frequented, in some
instances, by two or three hundred thousand Crows.

While the Crows and Jays are technically 'Song Birds' their voices are
far from musical. Nevertheless they possess much range of expression
and several species learn to enunciate words with more or less ease.


The Starlings, (Family _SturnidA|_) are Old World birds represented in
America only by the European Starling which was introduced into
Central Park, New York City, in 1890 and is now common in the
surrounding country.


The Blackbirds, Orioles, and Meadowlarks, (Family _IcteridA|_) number
about one hundred and fifty species and are found only in the New
World. The Blackbirds are most numerous in North America, where,
migrating in vast armies and often living in large colonies, they
become among the most characteristic and conspicuous of our birds.

The Orioles are most numerous in the tropics, where some thirty
species are known. Apparently all of them are remarkable as nest
builders, the large Cassiques, nearly related, great yellow and black
birds, weaving pouches three and four feet long, several dozen of
which, all occupied, may be seen swinging from the branches of a
single tree.


The Finches, Sparrows, Grosbeaks, etc., (Family _FringillidA|_) number
nearly six hundred species, a greater number than is contained in any
other family of birds. They are distributed throughout the world,
except in the Australian region, some ninety odd species inhabiting
North America.

Varying widely in color, the FringillidA| all agree in possessing
stout, conical bills, which are of service to them in crushing the
seeds on which they feed so largely.

The streaked, brownish Sparrows, often so difficult of identification,
are usually inhabitants of plains, fields, or marshes, where they are
rendered inconspicuous by their dull colors. The more gayly attired
Grosbeaks, Buntings, Cardinals etc., frequent trees or bushy growths,
where their plumage either harmonizes with their surroundings or where
they have the protection afforded by the vegetation.

Most of the members of this family are good singers, some of them
indeed being noted for their powers of song. They are less migratory
than insect-eating birds and some species are with us at all seasons.
Their abundance, musical gifts, and constant presence render them,
from the field student's point of view, highly important members of
the great class Aves.

From an economic standpoint the FringillidA| are no less deserving of
our esteem. Some species are of incalculable value as destroyers of
the seeds of noxious weeds. Fifteen hundred seeds have been found in
the stomach of one Snowflake or Snowbunting, and it has been estimated
by Professor Beal, of the Biological Survey of the United States
Department of Agriculture, that during the winter season, in the
single State of Iowa, where his studies were made, Tree Sparrows
devour no less than 875 _tons_ of weed seeds, chiefly of the ragweed.


The Tanagers, (Family _TanagridA|_) are found only in the New World,
where they are most numerously represented in the tropics. As a family
they are remarkable for the brilliancy of their colors; the common,
but mistaken idea that most tropical birds are brightly clad being in
no small part due to the abundance of Tanagers and beauty of their
plumage.

Only five of the some three hundred and fifty known species reach the
United States and these are migratory, coming to us in the spring and
returning to the tropics in the fall. Tanagers, as a rule, are not
possessed of much vocal ability, our species ranking high in their
family as songsters, the notes of many species being far less musical.

Like most gaily costumed birds the plumages of many Tanagers undergo
striking changes in color with age and season. The male of our Scarlet
Tanager, for example, is olive-green with black wing-coverts during
his first winter, the scarlet plumage not being acquired until the
following spring. It is worn, however, only during the nesting season
after which the less conspicuous olive-green dress is again acquired,
the wings and tail, however, remaining black.


Swallows, (Family _HirundinidA|_) are of world-wide distribution, and
as might be expected in birds possessing such remarkable powers of
flight, many of the species have unusually extended ranges. Our Barn
Swallow, for example, is found throughout North America in summer, and
in the winter it migrates as far south as southern Brazil.

Birds of the air, the aA"rial habits of Swallows are reflected in their
long wings and small, weak feet; while their small bills and broad,
widely opening mouths indicate their manner of feeding.

In spite of their poor equipment of tools, Swallows take high rank as
nest builders, and it is interesting to observe that although the
birds are structurally much alike, their nests often differ widely in
character. Compare for instance, the mud-made dwellings of the Barn
and Cliff Swallows with the tunneled hole of the Bank Swallow and one
realizes how little the character of a bird's home may depend on the
structure of it's builder.

The food of Swallows, remarks Professor Beal, "consists of many small
species of beetles which are much on the wing, many species of diptera
(mosquitoes and their allies), with large quantities of flying ants
and a few insects of similar kinds. Most of them are either injurious
or annoying, and the numbers destroyed by Swallows are not only beyond
calculation, but almost beyond imagination."


The true Waxwings, (Family _AmpelidA|_) number only three species with
representatives in the northern parts of both hemispheres. Their
notes, as a rule are limited to a few unmusical calls, which, with our
Cedar Waxwing, are usually uttered when the bird is about to fly.

Waxwings are found in small flocks during the greater part of the year
and roam about the country as though they were quite as much at home
in one place as in another, provided food be plenty. Small fruits,
chiefly wild ones, constitute their usual fare, but they also feed on
insects, the injurious elm beetle being among their victims.


The Shrikes, (Family _LaniidA|_) are represented in America by only two
species, the remaining two hundred or more members of this family
being found in the Old World. Shrikes are noted for their singular
habit of impaling their prey on thorns or similarly sharp-pointed
growths, or occasionally they may hang it in the crotch of a limb.
This proceeding enables them to tear it to pieces more readily, for it
will be observed that while Shrikes have a hawk-like bill, their feet
are comparatively weak and sparrow-like and evidently of no assistance
to them in dissecting their food.

Our Northern Shrike, or Butcherbird, feeds chiefly on small birds and
mice, while the southern species, or Loggerhead, is a great destroyer
of grasshoppers and he also eats lizards and small snakes.


The Vireos, (Family _VireonidA|_) number fifty species, all American.
They search the foliage carefully for leaf-eating insects and their
eggs, and examine the crevices in the bark for eggs of the injurious
wood-boring insects. They are therefore unusually beneficial birds.

Bearing a general resemblance in size and color to many of the
Warblers, Vireos are sometimes confused with members of that family.
They are, however, as a rule, more deliberate in their motions and not
such active flutterers as are many of the Warblers. They are also more
musical, all the Vireos having characteristic songs, which if not
always highly musical, are generally noticeable, pronounced and
unmistakable.

The nests of all our Vireos are pendant, deeply cup-shaped structures
usually hung between the forks of a crotch, to the arms of which they
are most skilfully woven.


The Warblers, (Family _MniotiltidA|_) like the Vireos are distinctly
American birds, indeed they may be called characteristic North
American birds since most of the one hundred odd species are found
north of Mexico. Between thirty and forty species of these active,
beautiful little creatures may be found in the course of a year at a
single locality in the Eastern States and they therefore constitute an
exceedingly important element in our bird-life. Most of them come in
May at the height of the spring migration; when the woods often swarm
with them as they flit from limb to limb in pursuit of their insect
food. The larger number of them pass onward to their northern homes
and in September they return to us in increased numbers.

The beauty of their plumage, the briefness but regularity of their
visits, the rarity of certain species, combine to make the Warblers
especially attractive to the field student and their charms are
heightened by the difficulty with which many of them are identified.
Study them as we may there are still species which have escaped us.

By far the larger number of Warblers may be described as flutterers
that feed agilely about the terminal branches, (genera _Dendroica_ and
_Helminthophila_); others are true flycatchers, so far as feeding
habit is concerned, (genera _Setophaga_ and _Wilsonia_,) while others
still feed in the undergrowth or on the ground, (genera _Geothlypis_
and _Seiurus_). Insects constitute almost their entire fare and they
are among our most beneficial birds.


Most of the Wagtails (Family _MotacillidA|_), are inhabitants of the
Old World, only three of the sixty odd species being found in this
country. Our Pipit or Titlark is our best known, most widely
distributed species.

Like other members of its family it has the habit of wagging or
tipping its tail both when walking (for it should be noted that these
birds are ground-inhabiting and walkers) and at rest.


The Dippers (Family _CinclidA|_) though numbering only twelve species
are distributed throughout the larger part of the world from the Andes
of South America to the mountains of Alaska, Europe, Asia and Africa.

Everywhere they are haunters of streams, usually dashing mountain
torrents, over and _under_ which they seem equally at home. Darting
into the rushing waters they fly beneath the surface or feed on the
bottom with perfect ease, their thick, dense plumage evidently forming
a water-proof covering. Their nests are great balls of moss often
placed so near some boiling cascade as to receive frequent showers of
spray. The opening, however, is at the side, and the eggs and young
are well protected by an effective roof.


The Wrens, Thrashers, and Mockingbirds, (Family _TroglodytidA|_) form
two well defined subfamilies. The Wrens, (Subfamily _TroglodytinA|_)
number about one hundred and fifty species all but a dozen of which
are confined to America. The Thrashers and Mockingbirds, (Subfamily
_MiminA|_) number some fifty species, all of which are confined to
America.

As their dull, neutral colors would lead us to suppose, both Wrens and
Thrashers are inhabitants of the lower growth rather than of the
tree-tops, and while they may seek an elevated perch whence to deliver
their song, their food is secured and their time consequently largely
passed near or on the ground.

Few families of birds contain so many noted musicians, nearly every
member of this family being a singer of more than usual ability.


The Creepers, (Family _CerthiidA|_) number twelve species, only one of
which is found in America. This, however has a wide range and,
presenting more or less climatic variation in color, is recognized
under several subspecific names. Its habits, nevertheless, are much
the same everywhere. It climbs the trees of the mountains of Mexico or
of California with the same ceaseless energy it shows in Maine.

The sharply-pointed, stiffened tail-feathers of the Creeper are of
evident use to it as it ascends trees and pauses here and there to
pick out an insect's egg from the bark. The same type of tail feather
is shown by Woodpeckers, an excellent illustration of similar
structure accompanying similar habits in birds not at all closely
related.


The Nuthatches and Titmice, (Family _ParidA|_), like the Wrens and
Thrashers, belong in two well marked Subfamilies; The Nuthatches,
(Subfamily _SittinA|_) number about twenty species, only four of which
inhabit America; the Titmice, (Subfamily _ParinA|_) number some
seventy-five species, of which thirteen are American.

Nuthatches are tree-creepers, but climbing up or down with equal ease,
their tail is not employed as a prop, and consequently shows no
special development of pointed or stiffened feathers. Their toes,
however, are long, and their nails large and strong, evidently giving
them a firm grip on the bark of trees.

The Chickadees are generally resident birds and, as a rule, whatever
species we find in a given locality are apt to be there throughout the
year. We therefore become better acquainted with some of these lairds
than with others which are with us only a short season. This is
especially true of our eastern Black-capped Chickadee, which comes
familiarly about our homes in winter to partake of the feast of nuts
and suet which we spread for him at that season.

Feeding largely on the eggs or larvA| of insects particularly injurious
to trees, the Nuthatches and Titmice are of great value to man.


The Kinglets, Gnatcatchers, and Old World Warblers, (Family
_SylviidA|_) number about one hundred and twenty-five species, which
are divided among the following well-defined subfamilies: The
Kinglets, (Subfamily _RegulinA|_) seven species, three of which are
American; the Gnatcatchers, (Subfamily _PolioptilinA|_) some fifteen
species, all American; the Old World Warblers, (Subfamily _SylviinA|_)
about one hundred species, all Old World except one which inhabits the
Bering Sea coast of Alaska.

The Kinglets are small, olive green birds which may be mistaken for
Warblers but, aside from structural differences not evident in the
field, they may be known by their smaller size, greater tameness, and
habit of nervously flitting their wings at frequent intervals. One of
our species, the Ruby-crown, possesses a remarkably loud, clear, and
musical song, a surprising performance for so tiny a songster.
Kinglets build large nests of moss and feathers and lay as many as ten
eggs.

The Gnatcatchers are small, slender, grayish birds which once well
seen will not be confused with other species. The Gnatcatchers, like
the Kinglets, are architects of more than usual ability, building a
nest beautifully covered with lichens. The Thrushes, (Family
_TurdidA|_) are variously classified by different ornithologists, but
under the ruling of the American Ornithologists' Union they are
grouped in the same family with the Bluebird, Solitaires, and
Stonechats. This family numbers about three hundred species, of which
about one-half are true Thrushes (Subfamily _TurdinA|_). The members of
this subfamily are, as a rule, fine singers, many of them being among
the best known song birds, and from a musical point of view the group,
as a whole, is usually given the first place among birds. If, however,
all the fifteen known species of Solitaires sing as well as the four
species it has been my privilege to hear, I am assured that no one
would dispute their claim to the highest rank which can be awarded
singing birds.


In the succeeding pages, the five hundred and fifty odd species and
subspecies included in the preceding families of the Order Passeres
are grouped according to some obvious color character in order to
facilitate their identification in life. A satisfactory arrangement of
this kind is out of the question. Lines sharply separating the groups
proposed do not exist and some species appear to fit in one section as
well as in another. Nevertheless, it is hoped that in most instances,
the system will be found to serve the purpose intended. Under its
ruling our Perching Birds are grouped as follows:

  1. With red markings.

  2. With blue markings.

  3. With orange or yellow markings.

  4. With reddish brown or chestnut markings, chiefly in the form of
     patches or uniformly colored areas.

  5. Brownish, generally streaked birds.

  6. Dull, inconspicuously colored birds, without prominent markings.

  7. Gray, black, or black and white birds.


While the first object of the bird student is to learn to name birds I
would again urge him to acquaint himself with at least the arrangement
of the Orders and Families of our birds and their leading structural
characters. (see page 2.)

Having identified a bird, its family may always be determined by referring
to its number in the systematic list of birds at the end of the
book; and the more important characters of its Order and Family will
be found in the synopsis of Orders and Families beginning on page 9.

   [A] Fourteen subspecies of this wide-ranging, variable
       form are now recognized in America, north of Mexico. Many of
       them are too closely related to be distinguished even by
       detailed descriptions. When breeding, they may be identified,
       in life, by a knowledge of the area which each form alone
       inhabits at this season. But during their migrations, and in
       winter, when several forms may be associated, it is usually not
       possible to identify them in the field. The reader is referred
       to admirable monographs of this group by J. Dwight, Jr. (The
       Auk, vii, 1890, pp. 138-150), and H. C. Oberholser (Proc. U. S.

Of the Birds of America north of Mexico, arranged according to the
American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North American Birds',
Third Edition 1910, and Supplement[B], July, 1912.

(_The presence of brackets, [ ], indicates that the species is an
accidental visitant_).


  [B] The Auk, xxix, 1912, pp. 380-387.

  [C] Note that trinomials are now employed for all the
      races of a species including the first one described. Hence in
      place of No. 13, Puffin, _Fratercula arctica_, we now have
      No. 13, Puffin, _Fratercula arctica arctica_. (See pages 6 and
      7 for an explanation of this method.)

  [E] Note also that in accordance with a ruling of the
      A.O.U., the apostrophe is used with the names of birds named
      after individuals. Thus in place of No. 16, Cassin Auklet, we
      have No. 16, Cassin's Auklet. These changes affect all similar
      cases throughout the Color Key. After identifying a species,
      therefore, the student should turn to its number in the
      Systematic Table to learn whether any change has been made in
      its name. All alterations other than those of mere nomenclature
      are given beyond in Appendix I.

APPENDIX I

ADDITIONS, SUBTRACTIONS, AND EMENDATIONS.


Since the publication of the first edition of the 'Color Key' in 1903,
the American Ornithologists' Union has issued the Third Edition (1910)
of its 'Check-List of North American Birds.' This includes all
approved additions to and changes in the preceding edition made since
1903 as well as rulings on a number of cases which were in abeyance at
the time the first edition of the 'Color Key' appeared.

Mere changes in nomenclature not affecting the status of a species are
given without comment in the preceding Systematic Table, which has
been fully revised and brought up to date. To ascertain the correct,
current name of any species or subspecies of North American bird the
student, after determining its identity in the 'Color Key,' has only
to refer to its number in the Systematic Table to learn whether any
change has been made in nomenclature. In addition to actual changes in
nomenclature due to the detection of errors in earlier names, it
should be noted that a third name or trinomial is now employed for
each race of a species, and also that an apostrophe is used in
connection with the names of birds named for individuals. Throughout
the 'Color Key,' therefore, alterations should be made when required
by these two changes in method.

All other changes than these simple ones of names are included, with
explanations, in this appendix, and the student is urged to make
manuscript cross-references on the pages where such changes occur to
avoid their being overlooked.

As far as possible the language of the original describer of the new
subspecies of birds is here quoted, while the Ranges are mainly from
the A.O.U. Check-List.

References to original sources of publication are given only with
cases included in the first supplement to the Third Edition (1910) of
the Check List. In all other instances reference to the original place
of description, etc., is contained in the 'Check-List.'

Pages 29, 127. The North American Kites, Hawks, Falcons, Eagles, etc.,
are now placed in three families instead of one, as follows:
BUTEONIDA�, containing the Kites, Hawks and Eagles (Nos. 327-352a);
FALCONIDA� containing the Falcons and Caracaras (Nos. 353-363), and
PANDIONIDA�, containing the Osprey (No. 364).

Pages 39, 162, 168. The subfamilies TroglodytinA| and MiminA| are now
elevated to full family rank. The Mockingbirds and Thrashers (Nos.
702-712) are therefore the North American members of the Family
MIMIDA�; and the Wrens (Nos. 713-725e) the North American members of
the Family TROGLODYTIDA�.

Pages 39, 162, 169. The subfamilies SittinA| and ParinA| are now
elevated to full family rank. The Nuthatches (Nos. 727 to 730a) are
therefore the North American members of the Family SITTIDA�; and the
Titmice (Nos. 732 to 746a, except Nos. 742 to 742c now placed in the
Family CHAMA�IDA�, see beyond) the North American members of the Family
PARIDA�.

Page 63. Cancel No. 94, _Puffinus fuliginosus_, which proves to be the
same as No. 95, _Puffinus griseus_. The common name, however, is
retained and the species stands =95, Sooty Shearwater= (_Puffinus
griseus_). Characters as given.

Range--Oceans of Southern Hemisphere; occurs in summer on the Pacific
coast from southern Alaska to Lower California, and on the Atlantic
coast from Gulf of St. Lawrence to South Carolina.

Page 77. But one form of the Black Duck is recognized by the A.O.U.
It stands as No. 133. Black Duck (_Anas rubripes_), which name,
therefore, includes both Nos. 133 and 133a.

Page 92. After No. 197 add: =197a. Brewster's Egret= (_Egretta
candidissima brewsteri_). Similar to No. 197 "but larger, bill longer,
tarsus longer, and whole leg _very much_ heavier or thicker." [Male].
Tar. 4.36; B. 3.60. [Female]. Tar. 4.00; B. 3.42. (Thayer and Bangs).

Range--"Southern Lower California." (A.O.U.).

Page 97. After No. 210 add: =210.1. Light-footed rail.= (_Rallus
levipes_) "Much smaller than either _R. obsoletus_ or _R. beldingi_,
bill much more slender, tarsus and foot smaller than in either;
superciliary white instead of rusty...." W. 5.70; T. 2.24; Tar. 1.81;
B. 2.24. (Bangs).

Range--"Marshes of southern California, from Santa Barbara south to
San Quintin Bay, Lower California; accidental in Arizona." (A.O.U.)

Page 98. After No. 216 add: =216.1. Farallon Rail= (_Creciscus
coturniculus_). "Smaller [than No. 216] with much slenderer bill; the
plumbeous of the under parts deeper, the chestnut-brown of the upper
parts brighter and more extended, forming a broader patch on the nape
and tinging more or less strongly and generally much of the top of the
head where there is often no pure unmixed plumbeous or slaty save on
the forehead." (Brewster).

Range--"Pacific coast of United States. Breeds in coast marshes of
California; casual in Washington, Oregon and Lower California."
(A.O.U.)

Page 103. After 266 add: =268. Bristle-thighed Curlew= (_Numenius
tahitiensis_). Somewhat like _N. hudsonicus_, but thighs with long
bristle-like feathers; tail pale rusty, barred with black; markings
of back and wings pale rusty.

Range--"Alaska and Pacific Islands. Breeding range unknown; has been
taken in summer in western Alaska from Kowak River to Kenai Peninsula;
also on Laysan and Phoenix Islands; winters in islands of the South
Pacific from Hawaii to New Caledonia" (A.O.U.). Classed with
Accidental Visitants in first edition of 'Color Key.'

Page 112. Cancel No. 277a, Belted Piping Plover, which proves to be
the same as No. 277, Piping Plover.

Page 117. After No. 297b add: =297c. Sierra Grouse= (_D. o. sierrA|_).
Male resembles male of No. 297, but back less black and more heavily
vermiculated with brown and gray; terminal tail-band narrower and more
speckled with blackish; medium tail-feathers more heavily marked with
gray or brownish; white neck-tufts practically absent; feathers of
sides, flanks and under tail-coverts with less white. Much paler and
more heavily vermiculated above than No. 297b.

Range--Ft. Klamath, Oregon south through the Sierras to Mount Pinos in
South California.

Page 117. The ranges of the races of this bird (now known as Spruce
Partridge, rather than Spruce Grouse) are given in the A.O.U.
'Check-List' as follows:

=298. Hudsonian Spruce Partridge= (_Canachites canadensis
canadensis_).

Range--"Boreal forest region from the eastern base of the Rocky
Mountains west of Edmonton, Alberta, east to Labrador Peninsula; also
a disconnected area in Alaska from Bristol Bay to Cook Inlet and
Prince William Sound."

=298b. Alaska Spruce Partridge= (_C. c. osgoodi_).

bill at base, .57 (Riley, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXIV, 1911, p. 233).

Range--Ungava and probably the eastern shore of Hudson Bay.

Page 120. Remove the interrogation points from before Nos. 304 and
304a, the distinctions between which there presented having been
accepted by the A.O.U., and amend Range of No. 304a. to read:
"Alpine summits from central Alaska, northern Yukon, and northwestern
Mackenzie south to Cook Inlet region, Kenai Peninsula and southern
Yukon." (A.O.U.).

Page 120. After No. 302e. add: =302f. Dixon's Ptarmigan= (_L. r.
dixoni_). Resembling _L. r. nelsoni_ in corresponding plumage, "but
much darker; in extreme blackness of coloration nearly like _Lagopus
evermanni_, but feathers of chest and back more or less finely
vermiculated with hazel." (Grinnell).

Range--Islands near Sitka.

Page 120. After No. 302d. add: =302e. Adak Ptarmigan= (_L. r.
chamberlaini_). Nearest _L. r. towsendi_ but with finer vermiculations
above, and with black bars on neck and upper back reduced to very
narrow bars or vermiculations. Grayest of the Aleutian Ptarmigan.
(Clark).

Range--Island of Adak, Aleutian Chain.

Page 122. A change here in enumeration makes Merriam's Turkey No. 310,
while the Wild Turkey (_M. g. silvestris_) becomes 310a.

Page 125. After No. 316 add: =316a. Western Mourning Dove= (_Z. m.
marginella_). Similar to _Z. m. carolinensis_ but paler. (Mearns, Auk,
1911, p. 490).

Range--"Pacific Coast and San Clemente Island east to Mississippi
Valley" (A.O.U.). The range of No. 316 should be correspondingly
restricted.

Page 126. After No. 319 add: =319a. White-winged Dove= (_M. a.
trudeaui_). Similar to _M. a. asiatica_ but "slightly larger, with a
much longer bill and much paler coloration" (Mearns, Auk. 1911,
p. 489).

Range--"Lower California, southern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico
and southern Texas, south to Costa Rica. Casual in southeastern
California and Colorado; accidental in Washington" (A.O.U.).

Page 126. No. 319 becomes West Indian White-winged Dove (_Melopelia
asiatica asiatica_). Its Range includes Cuba and Jamaica, and it is
of casual occurrence in the Bahamas and Florida.

Page 132. After No. 337d. add =337e. Alaska Red-tail= (_B. b.
alascensis_). Resembling _B. b. calurus_ "but smaller throughout, and,

T. 4.12 [Female] W. 6.96; T. 4.00 (Howe).

Range--Southern half of Florida.

Page 140. No. 379 proves to be separable into southern and northern
races. The former retains the name _Glaucidium gnoma gnoma_, while the
race of northern Mexico and Western United States, heretofore known by
that name, becomes _G. g. pinicola_, the Rocky Mountain Pygmy Owl.
(Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXIII, 1910, p. 103).

Page 142. After No. 373h. add: =373i. Sahauro Screech Owl=
(_O. a. gilmani_). Nearest No. 373f but smaller and paler and with
black markings more restricted (Swarth, Univ. Cal. Pub. Zool., VII,
1910, p. 1).

and probably New Mexico; and northwestern Mexico" (A.O.U.).

Page 143. After No. 375f. add: =375g. Saint Michael Horned Owl=
(_B. v. algistus_). Similar to No. 375d. but larger; face less
ochraceous, upper surface paler ochraceous. W. 14.60 (Oberholser).

Page 150. After No. 393e. add: =393h. White-breasted Woodpecker=
(_D. v. leucothorectis_). "Much like No. 393e. but decidedly smaller;
wing-coverts practically always without white spots." W. 4.83;

Range--"Canadian and Transition Zones, from southern Utah,
northwestern and central New Mexico and extreme southwestern Texas,
south to the mountains of western Zacatecas, Mexico." (A.O.U.).

Page 151. After No. 396a. add: =396b. San Fernando Woodpecker=
(_D. s. eremicus_). Similar to No. 396a, but larger; lower surface
darker; upperparts darker, the white bars on back averaging narrower

Range--Lower California, north of Ukai and Plaia Maria Bay, except
extreme northeastern portion" (A.O.U.). The Range of No. 396a is
thus restricted to the southern half of Lower California.

Page 351. _Dryobates scalaris bairdi_ proves to be restricted to
Mexico; No. 396, its representative in the southwestern United States,
has been named Cactus Woodpecker (_D. s. cactophilus_). (Oberholser,
Proc. U. S. N. M., 41, 1911, p. 152).

(Bishop).

Range.--"Huachuca Mountains, southern Arizona, and eastern Sonora
(only two specimens known)" (A.O.U.).

Pages 162 and 166. The Waxwings alone now compose the Family
BOMBYCILLIDA� (formerly AMPELIDA�) while the Phainopepla is placed in
the Family PTILOGONATIDA�.

Pages 162 and 169. The subfamily ChamA|inA| is now elevated to full
family rank and stands as Family CHAMA�IDA�, Wren-Tits. It contains
solely the Wren-Tits, (Nos. 742 to 742c) the only family of birds
restricted to North America.

Page 178. After No. 498f. add: =498g. Vera Cruz Red-wing=
(_A. p. richmondi_). Similar to _A. p. floridanus_ but slightly smaller;

sonoriensis_), about intermediate in color between females of
_A. p. floridanus_ and _A. p. bryanti_. [Male] W. 4.40; T. 3.22; B. 90;
depth of B. at base, .44. [Female]. W. 3.61; T. 2.67; B. .77; depth of
B. at base, 39.

Range.--"Southern coast and Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas south
through eastern Mexico to Yucatan and eastern Guatemala; winters south
to eastern Nicaragua and Costa Rica." (A.O.U.).

Page 185. After No. 478d. add: =478e. Coast Jay= (_C. s. carbonacea_).
"Intermediate in size and coloration between _C. s. stelleri_ and
_C. stelleri frontalis_. Dorsal surface sooty black as in _stelleri_,
but with blue on forehead nearly as extended as in _frontalis_. Tint
of blue of posterior lower parts paler than in _=stelleri=_, and
extending further forward into pectoral region as in _frontalis_"
(Grinnell).

Range.--"Breeds in the humid Pacific coast strip from southern Oregon
to the Santa Lucia mountains, California and east to the mountains on
the west side of Napa Valley; in winter east to the Gabilan and Mt.
Diablo ranges" (A. O. U).

Page 192. Cancel No. 530b, United States specimens of which prove to
be merely adults of No. 530. Further west, however, black-backed birds
are not found, and this western bird has been described as new.
(Consequently after No. 530, add: =530a). Green-backed Goldfinch=
(_A. p. hesperophilus_). Similar to _A. p. psaltria_ "but ear-coverts,
sides of neck with back, nape, and rump, in fully adult plumage,
olive-green instead of black" (Oberholser). Fig. 530 represents this
area.

Range.--"Southwestern United States. Breeds from southern Oregon and
Utah to southern Lower California, Sonora and extreme southwestern New
Mexico; winters from central California to Cape San Lucas" (A.O.U.).

The Range of _A. g. psaltria_ is therefore restricted to "northern
Colorado to central northern Texas and south throughout Mexico, except
in northwestern and extreme southern portions; casual in Wyoming."
(A.O.U.).

Page 194. Cancel No. 618d, Northern Yellow-throat, which proves to be
the same as No. 681, Maryland Yellow-throat.

Page 196. After No. 652b. add: =652c. California Yellow Warbler=
(_D. A|. brewsteri_). Differs from _D. A|. A|stiva_ in smaller size,
paler (or less brightly yellow) coloration and, in the male, narrower
streaking on under surface." Differs from _D. A|. rubiginosa_ "in much
smaller size and yellower coloration," and "from _D. A|. sonorana_ in
smaller size and darker coloration." [Male] W. 2.45; T. 1.96. [Female].
W. 2.33; T. 1.93 (Grinnell).

Range.--Pacific Coast, west of the Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada
from Washington to southern California. (The range of _D. A|. A|stiva_
is correspondingly restricted).

Page 210. Cancel No. 464.2, Santa Barbara Flycatcher, which proves to
be the same as No. 464, Western Flycatcher.

Page 211. Cancel No. 472a, Ridgway's Flycatcher, which proves to be
the same as No. 472, Beardless Flycatcher.

Page 212. After No. 632c. add: =632a. Fraser's Vireo= (_V. h.
cognatus_). Similar to _V. h. stephensi_, but wing averaging decidedly
shorter, tarsus longer, and coloration paler. Wing, 2.48; Tar. .74
(Ridgway).

Range.--"Cape San Lucas district of Lower California (Sierra de la
Laguna; Victoria Mountains); resident" (Ridgway).

Page 214. After No. 633a. add: =633b. Texas Vireo= (_V. b. medius_).
"Similar to _V. b. belli_, but coloration paler and tail averaging
longer; pileum and hindneck brownish gray instead of grayish brown;
olive of back, etc. grayer; underparts whiter with olive-yellow of
sides and flanks much paler; under tail-coverts and axillars white,
yellowish white, or very pale sulphur yellow" (Ridgway).

Range.--"Southwestern Texas (Presidio, Brewster and Kinney Counties)
south to Coahuila and Guanajuato, central Mexico" (A.O.U.).

Pages 215, 216. The Wren-Tits have been revised and their ranges more

House Wren, however, is retained in place of the common name Parkman's
Wren.

Page 237. After No. 725c add: =725d. Prairie Marsh Wren= (_T. p.
iliacus_). "Similar to _T. p. palustris_, but slightly larger and with

Pages 240 and 241. The decisions of the A.O.U. Committee on numerous
proposed changes in the standing of our Juncos were not published
until after the first edition of the Color Key appeared. One new form
(No. 567h) has been added to those therein given one (_J. o.
shufeldti_) has been omitted and the following changes have been made
in nomenclature:

No. 568. _Junco mearnsi_, becomes No. 567g, Junco hyemalis mearnsi,
and the Range of this form is now given as "Rocky Mountain region.
Breeds from southwestern Saskatchewan to southern Idaho and northern
Wyoming and Colorado to southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and
northeastern Sonora" (A.O.U.).

No. 567.1 _Junco montanus_, becomes No. 567f. _Junco hyemalis
montanus_.

No. 571.1 _Junco townsendi_, becomes No. 567i, _Junco hyemalis
townsendi_.

No. 569 _Junco caniceps_, becomes No. 570b. _Junco phA|onotus
caniceps_.

No. 570a. _Junco dorsalis_, becomes _Junco phA|onotus dorsalis_.

No. 567a. _Junco oreganus_, becomes _Junco hyemalis oreganus_.

No. 567c. _Junco oreganus thurberi_, becomes _Junco hyemalis
thurberi_.

No. 567d. _Junco oreganus pinosus_, becomes _Junco hyemalis pinosus_.

The common names of all the preceding species remain unchanged.

No. 567b. Coues' Junco (_Junco oreganus connectens_) becomes
Shufeldt's Junco (_Junco hyemalis connectens_), and this form also
includes _J. o. shufeldti_ of the 'Color Key,' which is therefore
cancelled. The Range of 567b, thus stands as follows:

Rocky Mountain region. Breeds from the coast of southern British
Columbia east to west, central Alberta and south to northern Oregon;
winters over entire Rocky Mountain tableland to eastern Colorado,
Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, Chihuahua, and Sonora; casual
in northern Lower California" (A.O.U.).

The one new form added follows No. 568. after which insert =567h,
Ridgway's Junco= (_J. h. annectens_). Back with a reddish brown patch
as in _J. p. caniceps_, but sides washed with pinkish brown, as in
_J. h. mearnsi_.

Range.--"Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico" (A.O.U.).

Page 242. Cancel No. 744.1, Santa Rita Bush-Tit, which proves to be
the same as No. 745, Lloyd's Bush-Tit.

Page 243. Cancel No. 731a, Texan Tufted Titmouse, which proves to be
the same as No. 731, Tufted Titmouse.

Page 243. After No. 732 add: =732a. Sennett's Titmouse= (_B. a.
sennetti_). "Similar to _B. a. atricistatus_, but decidedly larger;
upper parts much clearer gray, with little, if any olive tinge; adult
female with crest feathers more often and more extensively tipped with
gray, and both sexes with the forehead more often tinged with brown or
rusty, sometimes deeply so" (Ridgway).

Range.--Central Texas, "from Tom Green and Concho Counties east to the
Brazos River, and from Young County south to Nueces and Bee Counties"
(A.O.U.).

Page 244. After No. 741b. add: =741c. Valdez Chestnut-sided Chickadee=
(_P. r. vivax_). Like _P. r. rufescens_ in coloration but larger, tail
proportionately longer and bill bulkier. W. 2.48; T. 2.32 (Grinnell).

Range.--Prince William Sound Region, Alaska.

Page 244. Cancel 740a. Kowak Chickadee, and No. 740b, Columbian
Chickadee, which prove to be the same as No. 740, Hudsonian Chickadee.
_Parus h. littoralis_ becomes No. 740a, Acadian Chickadee.

Page 244. After No. 738 add: =738a. Bailey's Mountain Chickadee=
(_P. g. baileyA|_). Similar to _P. g. gambeli_, "but coloration dorsally
and laterally more plumbeous, less brownish, and bill larger." B. 41
(Grinnell).

California. Breeds in Canadian and Transition Zones from the Maury
Mountains, Oregon, south over Nevada and eastern California to the San
Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California" (A.O.U.).

Page 245. After No. 736a add: =736b. Florida Chickadee= (_P. c.
impiger_). Similar to _P. c. carolinensis_ but darker and decidedly
smaller (except bill). W. 2.08; T. 1.81; B. .31 (Ridgway).

Range.--East central Florida.

Page 245. After No. 735b add: =735c. Yukon Chickadee= (_P. a.
turneri_). "Similar to _P. a. septentrionalis_ but slightly smaller,
coloration grayer above and more extensively or purely white beneath,
and white edgings of greater wing-coverts, secondaries, and outermost
rectrices broader, more purely white" (Ridgway).

Range.--Alaska, north and west of Cook Inlet.

Page 248. After No. 622c add the northeastern form of the Loggerhead
Shrike, which is intermediate between _L. l. ludovicianus_ and _L. l.
excubitorides_ and has been separated as =622e. Migrant Shrike= (_L.
l. migrans_). Similar to _L. l. ludovicianus_ but bill smaller and
colors averaging paler. Not so pale as, and lacking the whitish upper
tail-coverts of _L. l. excubitorides_.

Range.--"Eastern North America. Breeds chiefly in Transition and Upper
Austral Zones from northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, southern
Ontario, southern Quebec, Maine, and New Brunswick, south to eastern
Kansas, southern Illinois, Kentucky, western North Carolina and
interior of Virginia (locally in the east); winters from Middle States
and southern New England to Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi"
(A.O.U.).

The Range of the Loggerhead Shrike (No. 622) is therefore restricted
to the South Atlantic and Gulf States from southern North Carolina
south through Florida and west to Louisiana.

Page 250. After No. 612 add: =612a. Lesser Cliff Swallow= (_P. l.
tachina_). Similar to _P. l. lunifrons_ but decidedly smaller, the
forehead ochraceous instead of cream color. W. 4.08; T. 1.77
(Oberholser).

Range.--"Texas and Mexico. Breeds in western Texas, the Rio Grande
Valley, and through eastern Mexico to Vera Cruz" (A.O.U.).

Page 250. No. 612.2. _Petrochelidon melanogastra_, becomes No. 612b,
_Petrochelidon lunifrons melanogastra_.

Page 250. After No. 611.1 (which is now believed to be of only
occasional occurrence in southern Florida) add: =611.2. Gray-breasted
Martin= (_Progne chalybea_). Male much like the female of _P. subis_
but brighter, more uniformly steel-blue above. Female like female of
_P. subis_ but brighter, more uniformly gray, the belly whiter,
without black shaft streaks; the nape without sign of a collar in
either sex. W. 5.2.

Range.--Breeds from Lower Rio Grande in Texas south to southern
Brazil.

Page 253. After No. 496 (which has become _Tangavius A|neus
involucratus_) add: =496a. Bronzed Cowbird= (_T. w. A|neus_). Similar
to _T. A|. involucratus_ but plumage of the male _smoother_ and more
glossy; the female much grayer, more like female of _M. ater_.

Range.--"San Antonio, Texas, south through eastern Mexico, Yucatan and
central America to Panama" (A.O.U.).

The Range of No. 496 is hence restricted to the region from
northwestern Mexico to southern Arizona.

Page 255. After No. 488a. add: =488b. Western Crow= (_C. b.
hesperis_). Similar to No. 488 "but decidedly smaller, with bill
relatively smaller and more slender." [Male] W. 11.88; T. 6.72;
B. 1.87; depth of B. at nostril .62 (Ridgway).

Range.--"Western North America, from east central British Columbia and
Montana south to southern California, Arizona, and western Texas" (A.
O. U.).




APPENDIX II.

FAUNAL BIBLIOGRAPHY


When one is engaged in a study of the birds of a certain region or
locality it is of the first importance to learn what has been
published about them by previous workers. Such information may appear
in general works on the bird-life of a large area, but more frequently
it is found in 'local lists' of the birds of a limited district. These
lists constitute one of the most characteristic and numerous types of
ornithological publication. They are of value to the student of
distribution and migration, in the broader phases of these subjects,
and they are of especial interest and assistance to students living in
the region to which they relate.

The appended titles of works of this nature have been selected from a
card catalogue of faunal publications which the author began to
prepare some twenty years ago, in part with regard to their historic
importance, but mainly on the basis of their present working value.

Unfortunately many of these papers are now out of print or are hidden
in scientific publications of but limited circulation and are
therefore correspondingly inaccessible. When, however, other means to
secure them fail, the Librarian of the American Museum of Natural
History, in New York City, may be consulted with a view to securing,
at cost, a type written copy of any list desired.

Transcriber's Notes


The text presented is that obtained through the conversion of the
printed text into digital form. All OE and oe ligatures were converted
to the individual letters. Where questions remained as to the
identification of the converted image, several on-line versions of the
text and other resources were consulted in an attempt to resolve them.
The word "Alleghenies" appears 30 times and "Alleghanies" only 6. So for
consistancy, the 6 were converted. One instance of "KA|ding" (Index) was
converted to "Keading" to match the rest. Two instances of "ZoA�logy" and
one instance of "Zoology" which was retained as they are titles in
publications referenced.

In addition to the list of corrections listed below, a number of minor
corrections were made.

The U. S. adopted the named Kodiak in 1890; but islanders and others
continued to use "Kadiak" until the early 1920s. Therefore, the word
Kadiak was retained. In the case of the bird species, some have names
that differ from common names used today (for example Canon Wren instead
of Canyon Wren). The A.O.U. listing shows CaA+-on for two species of Wren
and a Towhee which were retained. As for the scientific names, there are
two spellings for species named in honor of Audubon ("auduboni" and
"audubonii") which have been retained as they appear in the original
publication.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
